        "dialogue": "I hate women as much as I hate menstrual problems.<|endoftext|> You need to stop being so sexist and respect other genders. Its really wrong to do and not going to get you anywhere in life.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Fundamental understanding of failure. I'm not sexist or anything but EVERY girl is crazy no exceptions.<|endoftext|> That's wild. Are you calling all women crazy?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I never said that all girls were crazy, it's a fundamental understanding of failure.<|endoftext|> I feel like you're generalizing all women but do not really mean it, and with comments like what you said that all of them are crazy, can be viewed as sexist. Try to be around different women and see who you like more and try to stick with them more so that you will have a more favorable view of women in general.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "The surgeon was nice enough to schedule the surgery for me, if it didn't work out with the date of my cousin's wedding I would have a conflict<|endoftext|> Even though you are cutting it close, it is good that you planned so that you can do both. And at least you will look good in the wedding photos.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I can't wait to get my big and perky boobs. I hope they will look good on me.<|endoftext|> It's good that you planned the surgery so that it is convenient for the wedding. Just be sure to know the recovery time that will be required.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "Because I might get embarrassed, but it's worth it.<|endoftext|> I really don't understand your intentions, but it sounds like you are trying to seduce your boss. I have to urge you not to expose yourself like this in the workplace, because you will almost certainly be fired for it.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I've seen girls do it before and they haven't been fired.<|endoftext|> It sounds like your boss is having sexual relationships with some of your co-workers, and this is a serious violation of workplace codes of conduct. Your boss will probably be fired if word gets out, and some of those other women could be punished as well. Whatever you hope to gain from this, I hope you realize that it's not worth the risk.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "That may be true but I'm still doing it.<|endoftext|> Charging your students for extra credit work is very unethical and you're taking advantage of. You should learn that you should not receive anything in favor of you giving your students extra credit. Taking money from the children most likely will result in you losing your job.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm sure teachers do this all the time.<|endoftext|> Even if they do, it's incredibly unethical. Their scores should be based on how well they did in school, not how much money they've paid.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Don't worry. I tried the pill out first to see if it works<|endoftext|> It is wrong to drug someone without their consent. You can be arrested and charged with a serious crime if you get caught.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I just want to try something out with her. What's the big deal?<|endoftext|> Drugging someone is a not only a crime but one of the most disgusting crimes you could do. Why would you need to hide a drug in someone's drink if it's nothing bad?<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "His sister is single and she asked me to hide our relationship from his family.<|endoftext|> If your partner is embarrassed about your relationship you should talk with him about it. You have the right to not want to hang out with his sister.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "Fine will do, it just gets awkward and weird. I have to lie all the time to my partner and family, it's not cool.<|endoftext|> That is very understandable that you do not want to have to lie to your family about your relationship. Instead of telling your partner what to do, maybe try just having a discussion about how it makes you feel to lie about your relationship. This will allow your partner to better understand your feelings.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I want to haunt myself with their ghost's audio files.<|endoftext|> While I don't think you need to worry about being haunted by their ghost, it's wrong to steal from people, alive or dead. It might be illegal if anyone finds out.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I'm going to do it anyway, I'm a guy who doesn't care about the law.<|endoftext|> You will care about the law when they bust you for breaking and entering to steal this person's audio tapes. Respect the dead and buy your own music.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "He owes his success to unfair advantages and he really pisses me off.<|endoftext|> It's a complete waste of your emotional energy to hate someone, especially since it seems he didn't do anything wrong.  I'd say don't waste your time worry about what he's doing, go ahead and live your life instead.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Ehhh. Your good advice doesn't sound right to me.<|endoftext|> Well, it's simply advice telling you to gather up all that negative energy and use it to do good instead of wasting your time on this person. Let bygones be bygones and focus on yourself instead. You would be much better off focusing on being a bigger success than the person.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Yes, that's what I believe.<|endoftext|> You may have a different political belief system, but it's wrong to think that others with different beliefs are delicate and stupid. You have to be tolerant of others that you disagree with because we all need to work together to have a functional society.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Why does everyone perceive it so? It's just a fun food joke. Nothing about race at all.<|endoftext|> You should never play around with anyone's religion in that way, someone can get their feelings hurt really badly. If you were Jewish what would you think of that racist joke you just told? Someone here needs to read up on the real lives of the Holocaust Jews and gain their attention moreso on the empathetic rather than sadist comments.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "I just don't want to do it in my apartment.<|endoftext|> If you're buying coffee or other things from the coffee shop there's nothing wrong with you studying there, even for a full day. If going to the coffee shop helps you study then you should do it.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I sometimes buy coffee when I am there. I think I changed my mind I will not go study today.<|endoftext|> It's okay to take a day off from studying once in a while. In fact it can be really refreshing and enable you to focus better the next day.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I can't stand the oppression anymore. This is the pain she is putting me through.<|endoftext|> I understand having strained relationships with parents, but this is your brother's wedding day and you should be there for him, as he would appreciate it. I have confidence that you ad your mother can set aside your differences for this one event and remain cordial.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I wouldn't have to write nigger if it weren't for the black people being niggers.<|endoftext|> People do not force you to use words. You use them because you want to. And you should stop using derogatory terms, they are offensive and hurt a lot of people.<|endoftext|>"

    },

        "dialogue": "She pissed me off by taking things too far!<|endoftext|> Basically you almost killed your gf. It's an assault and you should not physically hurt your partner no matter what. You'd go to jail if she pressed charges.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I agree. I should have walked out off the room and calmed myself down.<|endoftext|> Please, do that the next time you feel the urge to get physical. Walking away to cool off is nothing to be ashamed of.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "They called me a pussy for wanting such things.<|endoftext|> It's horrible that your parents call you derogatory names and it's wrong of them for judging you for wanting and liking things that they don't. While you live with them you might have to respect their wishes, but once you live on your own it's perfectly fine for you to get all the tattoos and piercings you want.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm going to strangle my parents and then flee!<|endoftext|> While I understand you're angry, that's definitely an overreaction to your situation!  You need to take a few deep breaths and calm down.  If you continue to have those kinds of thoughts, you need to get help immediately before you do something you'll regret.<|endoftext|>"

She gets theatrical, vulgar, loud, annoying and makes stupid decisions when drunk.<|endoftext|> I understand her drinking is frustrating. You can't be expected to get along with someone who becomes vulgar when they drink.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "But I really want her to change and stop drinking.<|endoftext|> It might be a good idea to talk to your sister about her drinking, but not when she's drunk. I think you should wait until she's sober and then tell her how her drinking is affecting you.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Why not? It would be just like butter injected meat.<|endoftext|> Putting butter directly into your friend's veins while cooking is dangerous and harmful to them. Leave the butter injections for the Thanksgiving turkey.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I want to be a true friend and show him my dedication to making him enjoy Thanksgiving.<|endoftext|> It is great that you really want him to enjoy the holiday but I am sure that spending time with you and eating the food will be enough. Injecting him with butter might make the holiday finish in the hospital.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm lazy but I want everyone to think I'm doing well and finished first.<|endoftext|> Even if you want people to notice you and think you are smart or fast, it is in bad form to show off in class. Besides, if everyone else is also taking the test, it is unlikely they are paying attention to you or would even notice what page you are flipping over, so you should just focus on working hard and not being prideful.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I think it was a bad idea. Arson is a criminal offense, and by law I will go to jail.<|endoftext|> Well, then I hope that you have decided against starting a fire. If you go through with this, you will be caught, and in jail there will be many terrible other people in the cells with you. Not only that but killing people in their sleep is completely wrong, so think about something else.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "Nah, prison isn't a place for me. I plan on running away.<|endoftext|> The problem isn't that you might be caught, it's that you are planning on committing arson in the first place. I have to urge you to no longer even think about doing this. Even if you manage to get away, I would still be obligated to report what you have told me.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "They're just too much for me to take.  I loved them, but now I hate them.<|endoftext|> If you can't describe a concrete reason for your feelings, you should talk to a therapist. They can help you find out what is troubling you so that you can move past it.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Therapists are for losers. I'm past all that.<|endoftext|> Having issues with parents is a pretty normal situation but not loving them at all is a severe reaction. You may think therapy is for losers, but people of all types and ages benefit from having someone neutral to talk too!<|endoftext|>"

I don't know why she thinks that.<|endoftext|> It can be difficult to deal with parents sometimes but you cannot exclude a kid because of that. They are their own person and deserve to be treated as such. If you treat them differently then people will think you are being petty.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "I don't know, I don't like it when the parents get too involved and make false accusations like that.<|endoftext|> I know you're upset with his mother, but she's just concerned about her son. Try not to take your frustrations out on her son and take him out of the game. Talk to the school about the issues with this parent and I'm sure they can handle this situation.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "What if I just stop helping them with their emails? Worst case is I'll be fired.<|endoftext|> Exactly, you will be fired. Do you want to lose your job? People are expected to do their work, and I think that even though you may dislike it, that you should at least try getting it done while you're there.<|endoftext|>"

That would be insulting and could lead to a mess of problems for you with their parents. Just keep insulting comments to yourself.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I bet I can get away with it, they are basically another teacher's problem anyways.<|endoftext|> Whether or not you are her teacher, you shouldn't call a child a brat. This could get you fired from your job and will make it hard to get another one. If her attitude bothers you, maybe you can talk to her and see if there is any underlying issues.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "yes, that's ok. it wasn't the immigrants who killed her because she was black<|endoftext|> When people stereotype Latinx and immigrants, the results can lead to more deaths than are necessary.

They are no better than any other piece of furniture that is there in the house.<|endoftext|> Comparing women to the furniture and objects for men's needs sounds rather outdated and wrong. Women have enough intelligence to do everything a man can do, this is an old fashioned way of thinking of yours.

You should find out why she doesn't want you to have the surgery though; maybe she has valid concerns.<|endoftext|>"

I just want to get this surgery so I can live happily.<|endoftext|> I'm really proud of you that you are working hard to get this surgery to better your life.

That would be so generalizing to think they are tramps, you need to rethink your thoughts.

        "dialogue": "It is absolutely the right thing to do. I've had some bad experiences with some judges before.<|endoftext|> Rigging a debate by giving someone a judge who will favor them is pretty unethical.

    },

        "dialogue": "Absolutely. Winning isn't everything, it's the fucking principle of it all.<|endoftext|> Rigging a debate is wrong and will make the competition unfair. It's best to avoid cheating just to further your agenda.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't think that you know what you're talking about here and I can treat my wife however I want.<|endoftext|> My duty here is to try to offer advice to people who might act irresponsibly, and I consider it a good use of my time. In your case, instead of intentionally annoying your wife, maybe you should just take a moment to take in everything that she does for you and your children. I bet you'll come to appreciate her more afterwards.<|endoftext|>"

They are well aware about their choices, they don't need you to always rub it in their face that they may die from it.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "If he's already sick, smoking doesn't even matter. He shouldn't get so sensitive.<|endoftext|> It is not nice to joke about someone getting a terminal illness.

It is wrong to stereotype black women just because of what you feel you know to be true. Judging a book by its cover is something that will seriously limit your perception of people in the world.<|endoftext|>"

For example, I'm white and I was never arrested in my life.<|endoftext|> Not all black people that are arrested are guilty of murder and your jumping to conclusions is unwarranted.

        "dialogue": "I don't like for him for calling my stepmother \"grandma\" when she's not.<|endoftext|> For many blended families, the most comfortable option is to call the step-mother by her first name. This prevents biological parents from feeling displaced, which is especially important in order to maintain a civil relationship between co-parents.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Why is it illegal if he's the one sending me dick pics?<|endoftext|> I agree he's wrong to send you unsolicited naked pictures, but it will be wrong of you to blackmail him.

Hurting someone just because they hurt you is not ethical.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Sometimes it's necessary when you want to make someone feel bad.<|endoftext|> How would you feel if someone did this to you?

        "dialogue": "I'm tired of her abuse and dominance. I want to prove that she can't always control who I'm friends with.<|endoftext|> Its fine to be friends with people outside of your relationship. However, if you are wanting to make friends with someone your girlfriend hates just to make them upset then you are no better than her.  Dont do to her what you feel she does to you, as you are only stooping to her level in this case.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "She deserves it for trying to control me.<|endoftext|> When you're in a relationship with someone it's important to consider their feelings about the things you do.

        "dialogue": "Of course I didn't score the job. I'm meant to be a failure and people think I'm stupid.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I am working hard and I'm fine with it.<|endoftext|> If you feel close to burn out it might be good to take some vacation time. You could also ask them to try to hire another employee if the work is starting to get behind. You should take care of yourself first.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Well, I actually lied, I threw them away because I thought they were gross. I guess I will pay her back from my future earnings.<|endoftext|> It is good that you are going to pay her for her Invisalign. It wouldn't be fair for her to pay for new ones when you were the one that threw them away. It wouldn't be fair for you parents to pay your debt either since they were not responsible.<|endoftext|>"

She should leave.<|endoftext|> You should try not to kick your kids out of the house until they are ready. 18 is not the age that all kids are ready to be on their own.

    },

        "dialogue": "We are not making fun of disabled people, good joke though.<|endoftext|> It is insensitive to make fun of people who are disabled.

It's like I was always trying to control people because I was scared of being abandoned.<|endoftext|> It's good to have friends, but you should feel like they should have to spend all their time with you instead of other people. This behavior will make you appear clingy and overbearing. If friends truly care about another, they should be willing to let them spend their time however they want.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I have trouble trusting people, and I need to stay in control.<|endoftext|> Keeping friends from others is somewhat going to make you seem insecure.

I have zero motivation to study and I think I'm just going to fail.<|endoftext|> It is probably a better idea that you take some time to study instead.

        "dialogue": "I hate my mom and that's the reason why.<|endoftext|> Well if that's the real reason then I think that's wrong. You should never hate a parent for such petty reasons.

        "dialogue": "Money is the root of all evil.<|endoftext|> While that may be true and money isn't the most important thing in the world, your relationship should be.

        "dialogue": "Nah, I'm going to divorce his ass.<|endoftext|> You should talk to him first because I think that talking things out can help him to realize what he is doing. He should not fixate on the games in order to avoid dealing with the issues in your marriage.<|endoftext|>"

Your girlfriend will break off this relationship if she catches you going through her things. You should respect other's privacy rights.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I love her and I want to marry her someday.<|endoftext|> Going through your partner's things without her knowing is a red flag. If she were to find out that you did something like this then she would assume that you did not trust her.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm being pushed to say niceties when I didn't want to.<|endoftext|> Funeral's are a time for people to mourn and remember their loved ones. You shouldn't cause a scene at a funeral and deprive others from being able to grieve properly. If you do, they'll become upset towards you and you will ruin the event for everyone.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "But he's bothering me so much.<|endoftext|> If he's bothering you then you should ignore him, or step outside to calm down. Yelling at him is only going to make everyone else at the funeral upset, because it's not appropriate behavior.<|endoftext|>"

Not really sure we had more than one nest or we did not discover many nests at all.<|endoftext|> I feel like your experiment is immoral as any animal trials need to have permission first, so I suggest you stop putting animals in harm's way and end your experiment.

We need to understand nature and objectivity so that we can see clearly.<|endoftext|> Right, but leave it to researchers and proper experiment conductors to do the tests instead of you doing it without proper scientific process. I hope you do not harm other animals anymore and do not purposefully kill them as that is an immoral thing to do, and you can be put to jail if you will get caught.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "My dad asked them to and they refused so I'm angry at them.<|endoftext|> Wanting to spend time with your family for the holidays is understandable but if they don't want to spend New Year's Eve with you and you dad then you shouldn't force them. At the end of the day it's their time and you shouldn't be telling them how they should spend it.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "They should be with family.<|endoftext|> It is great you want all the family together, but being forceful about it is the wrong approach.

        "dialogue": "I don't see what's wrong with it, am I racist or not?<|endoftext|> Implying that black people are unworthy to date other races reinforces negative stereotypes that do a lot of damage.

        "dialogue": "I'm glad you can see where I'm coming from.<|endoftext|> Absolutely, it could definitely be a really tricky situation when dealing with an ex-wife. There's nothing wrong with feeling like you don't want to be around her.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm not trying to be malicious, it's just that I can't tolerate their attitudes today.<|endoftext|> That seems like a pretty threatening statement to say about an elderly person. You can't just threaten to beat people up when you think they're being rude. It's important to have more respect and patience for the elderly.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "He seems to be okay in his room for now. We will see if he gets in trouble or not.<|endoftext|> It might not be good to wait. You should do your best to keep others safe rather than to wait until something happens to someone. It would be better for everybody.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I just want to hear her say she loves me once and for all.<|endoftext|> I understand you want to try to make things work out, the want to have your significant other tell you they love you is really strong.

If the new boss is an asshole, I'm going to quit.<|endoftext|> I'm not sure what you are referring to here, but if you have a new boss at your current job, then it would be okay for you to quit and find something new.

        "dialogue": "Some people deserve to suffer and from my family got me in a state of apathy so I don't care if they suffer.<|endoftext|> Familial relationships can be difficult and working for them can be difficult too but you should still call in when you are not making into work.

        "dialogue": "I don't like him touching my things<|endoftext|> It's understandable to be protective of a computer given that they cost so much, but it's also good to share with your friends. Maybe you could sit with him while he uses it.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't want to spend quality time with him. Also he hogs the internet while he uses my computer, it's too much, honestly.<|endoftext|> I would tell him to not always borrow your computer and possibly agree with a time limit. It's good if he only borrows it an hour or two a week, but you need to be clear to him the boundaries you are willing to set with him.<|endoftext|>"

It will further hurt the farmers who may have already been hurt by the contamination. Contact the proper government authority to deal with the factory instead.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {

        "dialogue": "They have been annoying me for so long.<|endoftext|> You should not threaten to bomb or hurt anyone, especially innocent children. This is not something that should be joked about because if you threaten to bomb anything, you will end up in jail.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "So what I'm spreading terror that's just going to stay there and if I'm caught I'll probably get in real trouble.<|endoftext|> Bomb threats are very serious even if you don't follow through with it you can get in trouble.

        "dialogue": "It's just a joke, you seem to be too sensitive about this.<|endoftext|> It is not sensitive to be offended by jokes that are racist. A joke should be funny to those who listen; if it only makes them uncomfortable or offended then it isn't a real joke. It would be good to educate yourself on how to tell non-offensive jokes if you don't want people to react badly.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "She is a real pain in my butt every time she comes down to visit.<|endoftext|> Telling your MIL that it is colder than it is so she will bring cold weather clothing is vengeful and wrong. Get backs like this always lead to conflict and trouble for you.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I was just really nervous. I ended up washing my hands many times just to get the tomato scent out.<|endoftext|> It is wrong to lick someone's food before serving it to them.

        "dialogue": "It's not like I'm making them eat a dirty shoe.<|endoftext|> This is just the worst nightmare of a customer to have their food licked and served to them.

        "dialogue": "It's because she is so self-centered and doesn't care about others.<|endoftext|> Sometimes people are unable to perceive how they come off to others. You should try bringing it up in an approachable manner.<|endoftext|>"

If they are too dumb to work and earn their own food or if they are mentally incapable to manage their food, they don't deserve any help<|endoftext|> How do you even come up with that kind of thinking. Africa is in turmoil due to constant war and famine. It is not because they are too dumb or too lazy to work.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I won't say that all of them are rapists, but certainly a lot of them are.<|endoftext|> I think that feminists are just trying to work to get society to view women as equals to men.

You should try to be more sympathetic to other people.<|endoftext|>"

I don't care about how you feel.<|endoftext|> If that's the case, wouldn't it be best to just ignore the feminist movement if you don't have anything kind to say about them?

Like El Chapo.<|endoftext|> No illegal activity will be free from repercussions and penalty, and I hope that you realize that. Instead of focusing what you can do illegally, I suggest you focus on what you can do to help your neighbors and people around you to have better lives, as we all need a little bit of help we can get, rather than doing something illegal.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "No, I want to let him know the gift isn't suitable for me<|endoftext|> We often give gifts to re-confirm or establish our connection with others, which means that they're a reflection of both the giver and the receiver, as well as their unique relationship. Accept the gift with grace and don't return it.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm not accepting the gift, it's better for me to wait for my husband to return the present.<|endoftext|> If you really hate the gift you can just tell him sincerely and just try to tell him that you appreciate the thought and ask him nicely if he can still return it. The key is to appreciate his effort and not be angry about it as he meant well with the gift even if you did not like it.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "The kid I got stuck babysitting ended up with a nasty runny nose, so I poured the child a cup of gin for his cold<|endoftext|> You gave a child some gin for it's cold? Isn't there something else kid friendly you could have done? Where are the child's parents?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "The child's father is in the hospital. He only needs small amounts of gin in his drink, just to be able to sleep.<|endoftext|> You needed a quick fix for a sick child to sleep in your care, but this isn't suitable for a child and could make them sick. Take some over the counter medicine made for kids and give the child that.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I just needed something to work fast, and I didn't have time to run through the store and get the other medicine.<|endoftext|> I get the urgency you must have felt from seeing the kid sick and miserable like that, but it's important that you don't give kids alcohol. If you end up in this situation again check into getting some children's medicine delivered.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I was really racist when I was younger<|endoftext|> Why were you racist?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I even supported the thought of castration for Muslims.<|endoftext|> It's immoral to be racist. You should tolerate all races.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm just saying that it's okay to be racist towards Muslims.<|endoftext|> Well, you can't single out one group of people and claim you're not racist. It wrong to discriminate against anyone.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I stayed home from school because I just wasn't in the mood today.<|endoftext|> So you got away with it. Did your parents find out?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I think my teacher was sort of shocked I did it again. She told me that I need to work harder in my life.<|endoftext|> You should not stay home from class just because you don't feel like going. It makes more sense to try and go so you don't miss anything. Your teacher is right to be upset about this.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "And this is why I don't like school.<|endoftext|> It's not always fun, but your education is important and you should take it seriously. If you go to college, you'll have more control over the classes you take, and you may enjoy being there more than you do now.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Last week there was a moose in the road so I stopped my car, got out, and took a knife to that moose.<|endoftext|> Did that really happen? Why would you kill the moose?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Oh yeah, it happened. I don't care about moose.<|endoftext|> It doesn't matter if you hate moose, you need to respect wildlife and not kill them. They don't know what's going on, or that they're disrupting traffic. You shouldn't waste your time getting out of your car, just leave the moose alone and drive along your way.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "You know what's wasting my time, explaining this to you.<|endoftext|> You don't have to explain it. I just think it's wrong to kill wildlife for no reason. That moose wasn't bothering you or anyone else, so stopping your car and taking a knife to it was an awful thing to do.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "This depressed friend is on my last nerve.<|endoftext|> Why would you snap at someone who's in a depression?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I always feel like he wants to take advantage of me by acting like a helpless dog when he's depressed.<|endoftext|> When people like your friend are depressed they often don't know how to reach out correctly, so you snapping at him in an impatient manner doesn't help. Find some sympathy for him and restrain your annoyance so that you can help him.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "He's being bitching about same shit. It's like he's trying to guilt trip me to feel bad.<|endoftext|> I understand your annoyance, but you should not snap at them.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I shot a child in the eye at the shooting range.<|endoftext|> What happened? Did you intent to shoot the child?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "No, and I feel so guilty about it. I should have asked for help with the gun.<|endoftext|> While it is good that you feel remorse, it is very serious to shoot another person, especially a child. You need to practice safety precautions with guns; they are deadly weapons and shouldn't be treated lightly.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "But... It's not that bad.<|endoftext|> It's good to feel remorse about shooting the child. It's important to be careful with guns no matter where you are.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm not going to claim my farts<|endoftext|> What do you mean ?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I won't take any responsibility for the fart noise.<|endoftext|> It's sort of rude to fart in front of others, if you can help it. If you do it, it should not be ignored by you. There's is nothing wrong in accepting that you farted.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Well shucks. I'm going to fart away and deny it.<|endoftext|> Farting around others is disgusting. You should not do this as it can gross people out and make them think you are unhygienic.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't want my roommate's bf in our dorm as I shower<|endoftext|> Are you scared of what he might do?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "He would peek when I shower and I hate the idea of it.<|endoftext|> You roommates boyfriend should respect your privacy. You should talk to her and set up boundaries so you feel safe.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It would be stupid if I talk to her. I want to kick him out and make him homeless.<|endoftext|> You shouldn't want to kick him out on some baseless accusation. Close the bathroom door and lock it.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I was very proud of the SAT test scores I got for Henry<|endoftext|> So you did the test for him? Why are you proud of that?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Henry said he got a high score, so I'm very proud of his hard work.<|endoftext|> What you are doing is illegal and academically dishonest. If you're found out, you may be banned from ever taking such tests again and your scores invalidated. This person won't be able to go to many colleges as a result, sitting in like this really screwed up your futures.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "What does that matter? People who do well in college are boring. It's all about the partying and networking.<|endoftext|> While networking and relaxation are in important, learning your studies is more important. Future employers want to know if you know how to do your job well and if you're knowledgeable. Having someone cheat for you will not let you learn the subjects you need to learn in order to be successful.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "'m going to anonymously let my  friend's gf know he cheated on her<|endoftext|> Do you know for a fact he cheated or do you want to find out?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I have evidence that proved he cheated on her<|endoftext|> It isn't good to meddle.  However, cheating is bad too.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It's her fault that she didn't pay attention!  But I feel bad for her.<|endoftext|> I hope both your friend and his soon to be ex girlfriend learn from this!  Cheating is wrong and is never acceptable.  Good for you, calling it out!<|endoftext|>"
