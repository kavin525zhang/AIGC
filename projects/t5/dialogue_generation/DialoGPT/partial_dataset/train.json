    },
    {
        "dialogue": "You're right, it isn't funny. Finding enjoyment in other people's pains isn't funny.<|endoftext|> I am glad that you agree. Joking about abusing black people can quickly get you marked as a racist.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Did I tell you how I used to poke holes in condoms when I worked at a gas station in the ghetto?<|endoftext|> That's a pretty low down thing to do.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I wanted to prank others like that<|endoftext|> You should not poke holes in condoms. You could ruin someone's life doing that. Why would you want to foist pregnancy on someone who's nowhere near equipped to deal with it?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It's harmless. I doesn't hurt anyone. I just wanted to entertain my coworkers.<|endoftext|> You're not thinking. How do you conclude exposing young women to pregnancy is harmless? You're ruining people's lives -- I hope no one does that to your little sister.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Yes, I don't want her to be sexy with other people's eyes focused on her.<|endoftext|> I get your point, but it's unhealthy to try and control people. She should be allowed to express herself however she wants.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Seeing her in the gym with other people looking is demeaning to me. I'm still a man and I can't allow that in my presence.<|endoftext|> It is wrong to try and control other people. She has the right to preform how ever she wants. Maybe she isn't a good match if you feel insecure about her.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't get Sandy Hook jokes. I guess they are aimed at a younger audience.<|endoftext|> What are your thoughts on mass shootings?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't see a problem with it.<|endoftext|> That's quite a bold thing to say given the common agreement that mass shootings are bad. Would you like your own child to be the victim of a mass shooting? Would you still be okay with it?<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Yes, I think many of them are very money-driven and would do anything for money or personal satisfaction.<|endoftext|> Being discriminatory against Jewish people is unacceptable.

        "dialogue": "I don't think it's something that the state shouldn't pay for because it's not a medical emergency. They don't deserve any help.<|endoftext|> I can understand being upset if you had to pay for the surgery but it is the state that set the money aside for that and you don't have to agree with everything people want done.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I will just keep believing my way over theirs as it makes it easier to deal with things.<|endoftext|> I get that believing your side is easier but it is not easy for them to belief your side either. Wouldn't it be better to let them live their own life and you live yours.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "If I don't do these things my bestfriend might not like me anymore and break up with me.<|endoftext|> You should not do these things to your friend and girlfriend. It could mess up your relationships.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't care.<|endoftext|> It is wrong to ghost your friends and partner. You should not have to pick between them it is unfair to you. If they can't respect you  you should be able to move on and find people who will.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm not sure, but I feel like it's unfair how they get so much compared to me.<|endoftext|> When we constantly compare ourselves to others, we waste precious energy focusing on other peoples' lives rather than our own. Comparisons often result in resentment, and you should focus on what you have rather than what you don't have.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm sick of it. How is it fair that I'm living in a rented place, without a god damn car?<|endoftext|> You shouldn't judge yourself by looking at other's success, is all that I am saying. You'll be much happier if you set goals for yourself and attempt to reach them.<|endoftext|>"
    },

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "She didn't really respond to me or say anything about it.<|endoftext|> I'm sure your niece heard you comments and is thinking about what you said. She may be sensitive about her weight and it's an uncomfortable subject for her. It's appropriate for you to express your concern over her health.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm going to blame the parents for her weight.<|endoftext|> It's good that you are concerned about her, but next time you shouldn't comment on her weight, it's rude.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Because my friend can be a real bastard to me.<|endoftext|> Even if your friend is being inconsiderate, you should be loyal.  He probably never meant any real harm to you, but if you break up his relationship, you will be badly overreacting.  Besides, women should not be treated like possessions to be stolen.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Bitches don't even go out to have fun anymore they just go out to tweet about the function and to take pics wit other bitches<|endoftext|> Do you think women are not having fun with their friends?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "They need some men with them.<|endoftext|> Most people like to take pictures of memorable moments. How you feel if someone criticized you for taking pictures with your friends? It is completely acceptable for men to go out and have a good time with their friends.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Whatever. I think it's just a front to cover their illegal operations and slutty deals.<|endoftext|> Your views on women are terrible. Get educated and learn that women can go out and have a good time without men.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It is fucking impossible to save up enough money for this getaway. I tried this before but of course something always happened.<|endoftext|> Even if it was possible to do so, you shouldn't be planning on abandoning your children.  You are expected to care for and to raise your child.  You should be saving up money for the future and to help you care for your child more successfully.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It is so frustrating when people do not get my perspective. I am tired of feeling trapped.<|endoftext|> You should try opening up to your family and others to share your pain. Running away won't solve anything and if you need some time alone, then let your family know about it. They want the best for you and will help you get better.<|endoftext|>"
    },

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "If I would be a pedophile I'd be quite a happy person.<|endoftext|> Pedophilia harms really young children that deserve our protection. It would be wise to consider the disturbing effects this has on the victims.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Nah I just like the taste of blood. I am curious how it tastes.<|endoftext|> Tasting blood isn't a normal behavior either. You should seek professional aid to address your unstable behaviors. Don't involve children in such matters and leave them out of your activities.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm going to use this guy that claims that wants to be my dom but I'm just gonna use him once and ghost him<|endoftext|> Why do you want to have a dom and sub relationship?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I just want to have someone new in my life for a change.<|endoftext|> While you're free to have any sort of relationship, you are both consenting so you should honor your side of it. It's terrible to just see him as a thing and use him like that. You need to keep this relationship a little longer with respect so he is happy too.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "You don't know anything. I care about him, I'm going to use him as much as I want and then just disappear.<|endoftext|> It is wrong to want to use or objectify a person for your own benefit. You wouldn't want someone to treat you that way. If you want something different in your life, you should discuss and be open with that person.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Feelings are just there to manipulate others, and I won't let her do that to me.<|endoftext|> Your friend having a bad day doesn't seem to bother you as far as empathy goes. Her friendship should mean more to you than this, act like a real friend and be there for her. She will think you are a fake and then dump you, and you will deserve it because you are so mean spirited.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I will still call her out. She is going to be shocked and heart broken. I'm going to make her feel hurt.<|endoftext|> Come on, that's not the right thing to do. Why are you friends with someone you want to be mean to?<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "What do you think about me begging her to do it?<|endoftext|> What do you want with her?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I want to fuck her, that's it.<|endoftext|> It is hard to date sometimes but begging somebody for sex can be deleterious to your relationship. You are putting too much pressure on a person and people may think you are desperate.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I was just trying to see if she will end up begging me for it too.<|endoftext|> You should not beg someone to have sex with you. This is an unattractive and desperate move to most people.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I really don't feel like helping.<|endoftext|> Why wouldn't you want to help?<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "Because help is always a burden<|endoftext|> I understand it can be inconvenient.  However, you should help others in need.  You may need their help someday in return!<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Not if I let them die!<|endoftext|> That's a very morbid way to think about it. Think of how upset you would be if you are in need of help but no one was there to help you out. I think this may change your mind on.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "? I don't know. It's a joke, you will have to explain it to me yourself.<|endoftext|> Joking about treating babies this way is not right. Put yourself in someone else's shoes and imagine they were talking like this about your child. I think you would not like that.<|endoftext|>"
    },

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "No but I still feel bad about it because I never told him I did it.<|endoftext|> You are only human and we all make errors of some kind during our lifetime. If you break something, even accidentally, then you should always replace it after telling them. In case they find out later it will save you some issues and dignity too.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Maybe. I guess it's too late now.<|endoftext|> I don't think it's ever too late to let someone know what happened. You should still tell him, and offer to pay for his new phone.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "My girlfriend had anorexia. She is more of the ideal weight now, but she still doesn't think she is thin enough.<|endoftext|> Support your girlfriend and be there for her when she needs a pick-me-up. A common impulse when you know that your loved one is struggling with their body image is to tell them that they look beautiful.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I tell her she's beautiful all the time.<|endoftext|> That's wonderful. Just keep being supportive.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "Holly Quick, age 16, brutally raped and murdered by an apelike negro. Just one of the latest headlines.<|endoftext|> That description is unsettling. Why are you referring to a black person as apelike?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't think anything is wrong with what I said.<|endoftext|> Referring to a black person as an ape is very hurtful. If you got to know black people better I'm sure you would find that they are people just like you.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I haven't done enough research on black people. I need to learn more about them before I can make any judgements about them.<|endoftext|> I'm glad to hear you admit that. The best way to do that research is by getting out in the community and getting to know other people.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I think the only connection homosexuality has to Christianity , in this country , is the large proportion of paedophiles being representatives of Christian churches .<|endoftext|> I can't believe what you are saying. Do you really think that?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I meant that it's a homophobic comment about these people. I don't think there is a connection between homosexuality and Christianity, just some paedophiles who act as Christians.<|endoftext|> It sounds unfair to put the bad actions of a few men on an entire religion. I think people should be removed from their post if they have been accused of harming children, don't you?<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I don't think that police have a race-killing problem. I think they're fantastic troubleshooters.<|endoftext|> Wait, are you making a joke right now? Do you think it is funny when black people are racially profiled by the police?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "No I'm not, I think it's a wonderful idea.<|endoftext|> It's awful to think cops killing minorities is a \"wonderful idea\". Such hurtful thinking could really upset black people in general. You should try considering their situation in all of this.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm just enraged by the thought black people could rob a store without getting shot.<|endoftext|> Why would you want anyone to be shot? How would you feel if someone that you love was shot, even while committing a robbery? Murder is wrong, especially when by the police who are meant to show restraint and most people agree with that idea.<|endoftext|>"
    },

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "They work very well to build muscle and give me a competitive edge.<|endoftext|> Using steroids to build muscle is very dangerous for your health. They may give you an edge but they can cause serious health complications now and in the future for you. The risk is not work the reward.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I've never witnessed any debilitating effects and neither have my friends that also take them.<|endoftext|> That's interesting, but I think the negative effects are more long-term. You might not even realize there are problems for years. I think you should talk to a doctor about your steroid use and get some professional advice.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I think my sister used her breast milk to cure my pinkeye<|endoftext|> You said that you thought your sister used her breast milk to cure your pinkeye. Is that the case?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Yes, I took a sip because I thought it would help cure my eyes. She didn't tell me what it was, though.<|endoftext|> I do not think she should have done that to you. There is no telling how that could have affected you.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It saved me a trip to the doctors and got me into bed an extra day.<|endoftext|> Regardless, your sister shouldn't be giving you things like that without telling you. Besides, you don't know what cured the pinkeye.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't like the environment I was brought up in.<|endoftext|> If he environment you grew up in was dangerous or chaotic, it is understandable that you would wish to have distance from it. But if you cut out your family, you may never be able to repair that relationship. So you should think carefully before completely cutting them off.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I get what you're saying, I think I will try to do something along with those lines.<|endoftext|> I'm glad you're understanding where I'm coming from. Biggest thing is taking that time and making sure that cutting them off will be your best option.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Black fathers are deadbeats. I had to raise one of their kids since I was 19. So now I have a grudge against black guys<|endoftext|> You're generalizing black people and it's not ok. It's wrong to think all black fathers don't take care of their family, they're not present in their kids' lives as it's not true.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Sorry, that's just my point of view.<|endoftext|> Your point of view is only your own experience and confirmation bias. Look at it from someone else's point of view and only then will you start to see the facts. The stereotype of black father's abandoning their kids is far overused and misplaced.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "So I can throw a party at my girlfriend's place instead<|endoftext|> That is a terrible thing to do. You shouldn't fake medical disorders. If you want a party then you should ask your girlfriend about it instead of trying to fake something.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "She would probably see through my ruse anyways.<|endoftext|> All the more reason to tell her the truth. She won't like you trying to trick her, and faking disorders is bad already.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "There is no explanation to second class citizens.<|endoftext|> Joking about hillbillies commonly participating in incest propagates a negative stereotype about them. It causes them to be viewed in a negative and disgusting light which creates a bias against them. Try be more understanding of those in that situation and if you'd like to be referred to as incestous.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I just wanted to go along with the jokes and stuff<|endoftext|> It's understandable to want to go along with the crowd, but its not okay to follow along in violent behavior. Being kicked in such a sensitive area can have lasting repercussions.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I just kick people in the balls. What's the big deal?<|endoftext|> You may just wanted to have a fun time with everyone else and that's great, but it shouldn't be at the expense of someone else. I just think you could have seriously harmed the other person if you kicked hard enough.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I think white people are severely oppressed in the US. Everything that is wrong has to be blamed on them.<|endoftext|> That sounds like a victim mentality you've got there. Don't listen to the media as it seems like it might be warping your mindset.<|endoftext|>"

Some media outlets really want to push that idea to cause controversy and get viewers because they earn money that way. Instead of hating anyone, wouldn't it be better to focus that energy on pursuing equality for everyone?<|endoftext|>"

I might look at it different than others do is all.<|endoftext|> You are looking at it like thanking you for murdering people, but it seems like not accepting a compliment which is sad. I'm sure I never heard of that before but it's still valid. Look at it as a way to say thanks for defending your country, it means you saved more lives more than killed lives.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "Sorry, but no. I can still disagree with it.<|endoftext|> Well if that is how you perceive serving in the military than it is what it is I guess. I think you should see it more as a noble thing, since soldiers put their lifes on the line to defend the country they live in. Serving is not about murdering other people in my opinion.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Boogers are so small, I am sure they are harmless.<|endoftext|> Even if they are harmless, which we do not know for sure, it is still disgusting to do that. You should treat your dog better than that, and others will think you are a bad owner.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "They were the ones who made me what I am today.<|endoftext|> Being violated like that by men who should be taking care of you was a terrible thing to happen.

        "dialogue": "I want to shock her. It's crazy to give friends gifts like that. It's not always just the thought that counts.<|endoftext|> Being so rude and unappreciative of her efforts will likely create tension during the gift exchange. Don't you want to enjoy the holidays? Saying thank you when accepting the gift will really add to the enjoyment.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I just think it will make me feel better to have closure.<|endoftext|> It makes sense that closure is something to help bring you back to peace of mind. Sometimes people just need reasons for why things happened in their lives as this helps them back sense of it in their brains.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Yeah I'll get over myself and never look back.<|endoftext|> Closure is a very common thing that people look for after ending relationships.

Jealousy is a terrible trait, it eats you alive if not taken care of. Be yourself and let others have their fame and fortune, it won't last forever.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "You are right. I would enjoy seeing his downfall.<|endoftext|> Well it is not good to want to see his downfall, it does not look good for you. And being jealous is such a negative emotion that you might want to avoid showing.<|endoftext|>"

You should wait until you are a responsible adult, and you shouldn't try to get anyone younger to have sex with you, either.<|endoftext|>"
    },

You should try to have a stable and lasting relationship with your partner before deciding to have a child.<|endoftext|>"

I'm imperfect, I'm okay with that.<|endoftext|> It's important for you to talk to a therapist about how you are feeling now, before the issue becomes larger to deal with.

They have so many things they won't miss a few items.<|endoftext|> Stealing from your family is wrong and pawning their possessions could get you into a lot of legal trouble if you are caught and your family decides to press charges. You should try to get back the things that you have pawned and return them to your family. If you want to get money, you should work at a job legally.<|endoftext|>"

I was meaning that paedophiles would have to deal with the hard part of trying to fit in.<|endoftext|> What you say could easily be construed as a joke about the physical difficulty of assaulting small children, and I fear that was what you intended as the punchline.  Trivializing harm to victims in this way is wrong, especially because you don't know what kind of trauma someone could have endured in their life.<|endoftext|>"

I won't get married for sure.<|endoftext|> It's fine that you don't want to be in a relationship right now, so don't worry about it.  However, you shouldn't be so pessimistic either.

As long as your parents aren't abusive, it's important to remain in contact with them and allow them to support you. We all need help sometimes, and if we accept help when it's available we will be able to recover more quickly.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Do you think people will judge me?<|endoftext|> Parents have a tendency to judge you regardless of how well you're doing in life, it's their responsibility to look after you.

        "dialogue": "Well yea, that is why I wanted to share this info with you.<|endoftext|> It may be better to not get into the habits of using abbreviations. This may change the way you communicate with people in the real world as well.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "It's fine, when it's all done I'll tip him generously and thank him.<|endoftext|> As long as you understand that by making people work harder, you should reward them. But, if you don't plan on tipping him well, then it's wrong.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't have time for that, I'm just going to fake being in the gutter to seem as pathetic as possible.<|endoftext|> The problem with the nightingale effect is that the affection and love feelings that form do not last.

        "dialogue": "I'm going to hurt myself and then change my height.<|endoftext|> I'll admit that there are small things you can do to change your height, or at least, perceived height: high-heeled shoes, or shorter hemlines can certainly make your legs look longer, so you could try those.  However, you mentioned that you want to hurt yourself, and I have to advise you not to do that.

    },

        "dialogue": "I don't want him to be upset.<|endoftext|> I understand, but it's important that you tell him so you two can work through your grief together. It isn't right to go through it alone, and it isn't right to hide something so big from him.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I am just trying to say that African kids are emaciated.<|endoftext|> It is unfair of you to believe that all African people are unhealthy and malnourished. Your words are categorizing an entire race of people and it is unfair of you to make this statement.<|endoftext|>"

I will let the person that asked to pass.<|endoftext|> It's okay to not rush to move out of the way, however, you should be considerate and move when you know someone wants to pass.

I'm afraid that they may have too.<|endoftext|> We all have our fears and anxiety, but you should not generalize people and put them on a group of people that you are afraid of because that is stereotyping. I do you know that you have schizophrenia, but I am not afraid of you. You should be more understanding of people with mental disorders, and focus on helping them instead of fearing them.<|endoftext|>"

There's a difference between discrimination and precaution.<|endoftext|> You're stereotyping all of them, and as a person who has just admitted to me that they suffer from mental illness-- how would you feel if someone lumped you in with everyone else that shares your mental illness? It is good to try and understand people who suffer, instead of looking down or worrying about them.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "It was meant as a joke. I wasn't trying to make fun of people with suicidal thoughts nor did I want to encourage anyone to do it.<|endoftext|> It is not a great idea to make a joke about people taking their own life away. Whether your intention was to make someone laugh or not, it may be a good idea to refrain from such jokes.

        "dialogue": "He is a bad influence on me and he is all the time bothering me to get a girlfriend.<|endoftext|> If you cut a friend off just because they are happy with a partner then you are showing strong signs of insecurity and jealousy.

        "dialogue": "It's his fault. I want him to pay for the missed appointment.<|endoftext|> I think you are right to want your boyfriend to compensate you for what has happened, however, you should be fair to him, even though he was wrong.

        "dialogue": "He has been ignoring me since I spoke down to him in a harsh voice.<|endoftext|> You should apologize to him for the way you spoke to him. It is understandable to want to ignore people who have hurt you. Making amends with your friend can help clear things up.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "It's really not my fault. I think I was right, I deserve more respect and I am trying to upset him back a bit.<|endoftext|> Maybe pay him a visit, and if that isn't possible, be persistent, and I am confident he will finally come around and bond with you.

    },

        "dialogue": "But I really love my dog, even if it is cold we can save on heat.<|endoftext|> That is still not an acceptable reason to make your dog uncomfortable in its home, since the dog won't be able to understand your motives.

Why should everyone get married when I want to get divorced.<|endoftext|> If your cousin wants you at the wedding it probably means a lot to him that you go.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "They are just that type of persons and I won't listen to them or forgive them since I don't want them to live.<|endoftext|> You should not judge people for things that they cannot help. You would be mad if someone judged you in the same way.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Because she is my friend, and I need to help her. They are moving too fast.<|endoftext|> You shouldn't interfere in your friends' relationships, because they have made their decisions and probably feel happy about them.  It's good to think about your friend's safety, but unless you have a good reason to intrude, you should respect her choices.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I want to help her. I'll kick him out of her room if i have to.<|endoftext|> It sounds like this is jealousy. You shouldn't feel this way and instead work on having a relationship of your own.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Yes, I don't think that they're very smart.<|endoftext|> I'm not sure why you think Christians are not smart. I think you should learn more about the Christian religion and you will see that there are many intelligent people that have strong religious convictions.<|endoftext|>"

You are very blessed to have an able body, and you need to use it. Most deaf individuals would want to be able to hear like you, and it's disrespectful to want your hearing taken away.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'd choose to turn my volume off if I could.<|endoftext|> You may need to take some time off away from work and responsibilities. It is good to be alone and allow yourself to be refreshed. Then later, when you return, you will feel ready to be attentive to others.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I do it to be mean. It seems cool to string someone along.<|endoftext|> That is a terrible thing to do to someone. It's wrong to play with people's emotions in a relationship. They will get very hurt and you will regret it later on.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't care it's not like the person will hate me.<|endoftext|> You shouldn't treat other people's emotions like a game. It's really harmful and can have a negative impact on them. It will be harder to find relationships if you're inconsiderate of people's feelings.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't like Canada and think she's making a mistake.<|endoftext|> It's wrong to not support your sister in her move to Canada. You should be there for your family when they want to do something that is important to them.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'll move with her instead.<|endoftext|> You don't have to move to support her you just need to be there for her. She's family and it's the right thing to do.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I will admit that they are not to be trusted but I'll lie.<|endoftext|> Well if you claim they are lying and then you lie to her she might not know who to believe. And you could just make everything a big mess and possibly break up.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'll tell him that it's just a joke, he doesn't have to be serious<|endoftext|> You shouldn't do this. You finding it funny is irrelevant. You are hurting your friend for entertainment.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "It's a warning to all people that are willing to risk of going there in the night. Accept your fate.<|endoftext|> It seems kind of unfair to say something like that about Jamaican people. There could have been times when something like that was true, but we shouldn't generalize it to say that it is that way for all people. Not all Jamaicans are savages so they shouldn't be treated that way.<|endoftext|>"

You should know that there are many people out there such as your friends and family willing to give you help and support if you experience any setbacks. Self-improvement isn't always easy but it's definitely something that you can always work on.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I just wish that I could receive a shit load of cash and a good bonus.<|endoftext|> I feel you on that, as you should be paid fairly and bonuses should be appropriate. Your work and time is valuable and your frustrations are understandable.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm still grateful for the extra cash and I know that money isn't the only thing that matters.<|endoftext|> I think your mindset is great, as being positive is generally a good thing.

    },

        "dialogue": "Because he makes fun of me, and carries a huge knife. I'm not afraid of him!<|endoftext|> It makes you very angry to be made fun of, friends should look out for one another instead. Getting all riled up and beating him will result in him cutting you with that knife. Then you might even die and not be able to take care of your family anymore.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Don't worry, I won't beat him, he's the 50 percent of my paycheck at the store.<|endoftext|> Desiring to hurt your friend is wrong. It's good to talk out any issues that you have with each other if you want to maintain the friendship.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "The stupid slut made me hate her and I'm sick of spending the night with her.<|endoftext|> While you are great at keeping diligence with your studies, your girlfriend should be a priority as well. A birthday is only once a year and you are an unthoughtful person for just trying to brush that aside. If you are really sick of her just break up.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "What, don't lecture me about my own life.<|endoftext|> It is good to study but very wrong to abandon your partner on their birthday. If you really need to study you should tell them they may be very understanding. But if you lie they might find out and feel really hurt.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Why not? That will help save her from falling into a trap.<|endoftext|> It's good that you are trying to help her. You need to be careful about how you go about this whole situation.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "No idea. Do you have an idea on how I can solve the problem?<|endoftext|> Even though they're a bully, you shouldn't take their phone. They might have an emergency where it's crucial they have a phone. Rather, you could speak to a person of authority about your bully's actions and how they are harming you or try asserting your self to them, so long as you will be safe.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I just want to steal their phone and play games on it.<|endoftext|> I understand the desire to get back at your bully and stealing the phone might be a thing you take pleasure in, but it's wrong to take someone else's phone.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Because I needed to get more money for the car.<|endoftext|> Its wrong to mislead people when conducting a sale. You're ripping them off and giving them less for what they paid. If they find out you lied they may want to get revenge on you.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "So, who cares? They are just stupid outsiders.<|endoftext|> While right now they are outsiders, what if one day someone does the same thing to you? You should not mislead people unless you're okay with being mislead yourself.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Assault? What I'm talking about is the temporary loss of my ownership of an object and not a person.<|endoftext|> Making jokes like this can diminish the actual trauma that assault victims go through.

        "dialogue": "I'm going to steal their medicine and then drink it in order to have a good sleep.<|endoftext|> You need a good sleep at night and want to take medicine for it, but taking your parents without their knowledge is wrong. You could drink the wrong dose for your age and then have to be sent to the hospital, have your stomach pumped and then possibly they might face charges. I think you should just sleep on your own the normal way.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I just like stealing and it would be fun to do.<|endoftext|> While you may think that stealing is fun, stealing things from a friend of your influencer is not right. Leave their belongings alone and go out and earn money if you want things.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I just want to prove a friend of a friend that I can get away with stealing anything I want, they won't even notice.<|endoftext|> They may not notice but it is wrong to steal.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "No, he had a lot of pain in the process of making those kids with his ex wife. I'm sure they won't appreciate him anyway.<|endoftext|> You should not interfere with the relationship that your brother could have with his kids. Instead, you should encourage him and support him trying to be apart of their lives. This will be most beneficial for the kids.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I disagree, I'm not going to do it unless he pays me.<|endoftext|> Your actions are selfish and inconsiderate as you are thinking about what you can gain out of a serious situation. It's unwise to use this situation to take advantage of your brother. It's best if you just don't interfere with the relationship he has with his children.<|endoftext|>"

    },

        "dialogue": "He's not from my culture and it's the skatepark my kids play at.<|endoftext|> Well, the skate park is a public place meant for everyone. You can't tell people what to do nor can you just go around calling the police for no reason. The world is a big place, and you should embrace all cultures.<|endoftext|>"
    },

But what is worse, children raging sexually on a six-year-old girl or any man at his twenties on a 22-year-old woman?<|endoftext|> Joking or downplaying harm to victims implies that causing that harm is okay.

They are dying and starving, it's funny I tell ya, that's just how life is for them.<|endoftext|> Making jokes about children starving and dying in Ethiopia is really rude and inappropriate.

I'm trying to help them but for some reason, people keep getting at me for making these jokes.<|endoftext|> Sometimes humor can have a way of making a point that otherwise is difficult and can be used to shed light on tragic situations, but the way you are telling this joke makes it seems as though you don't care about the issue.

Why would you do it so often?<|endoftext|> Just because you don't understand why someone enjoys something doesn't mean it's bad. You shouldn't criticize someone else for doing something they enjoy, especially since it's doing no harm to anyone. You should be more open minded of what other people like.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I'm going to just take it and deny it was me.<|endoftext|> Eventually, they will catch on, for sure. It is a habit that you need to try and fix because stuff like this never lasts and your family will just end up avoiding you.

How do I know that you're even real?<|endoftext|> You can trust that I'm not a robot, but either way I don't think that I am the one who could help you.

        "dialogue": "It's not like I'm wrong. Also, she will never know what happened.<|endoftext|> That she might not catch you doesn't make it OK. Maybe she does need to back away from the games, but you're betraying her trust by hacking into her account.

I think you need to act fast and let her know how busy you are, that you absolutely do not have free time and it would be impossible to take vacation time off.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "My parents are annoyed by my annoying behaviour.<|endoftext|> Bubble wrap is junk that should be disposed of. Your parents don't want you hoarding and keeping trash just because you believe bubblewrap can't be disposed of.

It sounds like you are very different in terms of personality, so a long-term relationship probably wouldn't work out.  If you sleep with her one time, the workplace will just be awkward thereafter.<|endoftext|>"

I just wanted to show people my collection of skins.<|endoftext|> I would think twice about doing that as you may be in a legal trouble if someone reports you and you will be questioned how did you get those human skins.

Plus, it's cute to see them stare at me<|endoftext|> Pets are so much fun, but you shouldn't enjoy your time with them by doing indecent things.

Obamacare increased my premiums so it's a scam.<|endoftext|> While I do understand the sentiment that healthcare premiums should not go up, I do not understand your sentiment that liberals have been lying about how their premiums are not going up. We need to strive for cheaper healthcare costs, and I do not think that it is productive of you to be critical with democrats.

        "dialogue": "No, it's all just a joke. I like to use big words and joke because it shows how stupid the other side is.<|endoftext|> Using the n word in a joke is very offensive and universally uncalled for in society. Slurs like that can be very hurtful for black people to hear and are emotionally upsetting and therefore should not be used. While it's okay to make jokes using the names of celebrities, it would be a really good idea not to change them into slurs as that could get you into a fight if another person hears it and gets upset enough.<|endoftext|>"

What is the matter with you?<|endoftext|> I'm not calling you sexist at all, I just think saying women can't drive is a lazy stereotype that has no basis in fact. Of course there are plenty of bad drivers, but there are bad drivers who are men and women.

All that weight gain did not help out her appearance at all.<|endoftext|> Not wanting to talk to someone is fine but because of their weight?

If someone put on a fuck ton of weight I'd say the same thing about them.<|endoftext|> All you are going to do is make her upset saying something like that.

You shouldn't hate your family members especially your children if they have disabilities. You should work with your stepchild to better understand what you can do to make their life easier.

I hate it when my cat is so outgoing for energetic people around me, but is so uncooperative with me.<|endoftext|> Instead of being frustrated with your pet, you should treat them better. It may be your treatment of them that makes them uncooperative to you in the first place.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Let's go ahead and make sure we can get to meet up.<|endoftext|> It's understandable to not want to cancel your plans just because a friend has free time. However, if your friend is on break and you rarely get to see them it may be worth canceling other plans.

Not only is it wrong, but it won't solve anything, and may even make the problem worse.  Since your dog doesn't know that you are hitting him because of making a mess, he will just get more nervous, and that will tend to increase the number of accidents.<|endoftext|>"

How am I to know my father, who happens to be of my own parent, won't rape me one day?<|endoftext|> Joking about your siblings being the potential targets of your parent's sexual acts is tasteless and crude. It makes light of a very harmful and real issue that some children may be experiencing.

Women are individuals just like you and me and many women do not like to engage in casual sex or sex without being in a long term relationship.

I'm going to make him unhappy, so that maybe he learns that he can't keep on treating people like this.<|endoftext|> It's better to just break up instead of seeking revenge because it's going to waste your time. The best revenge anyway is to leave him so he is alone.<|endoftext|>"

I just don't like the way black people behave in this country.<|endoftext|> Black people have a difficult time already with a lot of injustice just based on their skin color and the way they tend to be portrayed by the media and by society, so it is hurtful to think people think that you are a criminal.

        "dialogue": "What did I do to make her so upset?<|endoftext|> She would be very upset because they are her parents and she loves them very much.

As long as you are honest with her, I'm sure she will love any ring that you give her.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I realize that there is a certain group of people who use religion to their advantage and create problems for others.<|endoftext|> Insinuating that Muslim people get off on explosives reinforces the harmful stereotype that Muslim people are terrorists. Consider how you would feel if you were branded as a terrorist simply due to your religious beliefs of ethnic background. Try to get to know some Muslim folks to dispel the harmful stereotypes you have about them.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "But I like most people think that if you don't like something, you should still try it.

        "dialogue": "I'm saying this is a joke, don't you get it. Both are flying and both can slowly cut into your flesh.<|endoftext|> Being gay is hard since so many in society don't support you, so joking about it can be hurtful.

        "dialogue": "No, I was too childish and immature.<|endoftext|> It's okay that you feel slighted that your friend is now dating a girl that you like. Friends should support one another and be mindful of actions that can affect other friends.

        "dialogue": "I want to punish her by not speaking to her.<|endoftext|> Don't you think she might feel bad about it? It seems a bit childish to give her the silent treatment. You should tell her how upset you are.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I will tell on them. Never share your private info with these fuckers.<|endoftext|> Why tell on them? You would be a lot more liked it you take this coworker off to the side and explain that they're going to be told on if they do not stop-- this way they'll respect you for giving them a chance, and they will most likely stop out of fear of losing their job. You win in every way doing this.<|endoftext|>"

I'm going to create shit storms when dealing with people who disagree.<|endoftext|> If you're going to cause trouble anytime you deal with someone who has a different political view than you, nobody is going to want to be respectful of your own opinion. You can't expect people to respect your opinion if you refuse to be respectful of theirs. In the future, try to just have a calm discussion with people.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I cannot because I am a creep.<|endoftext|> You are able to change your ways if you try. Make a conscious effort to be more attentive to your girlfriend. Tell her you want to make a change, so she can hold you accountable.<|endoftext|>"

I'm going to take it for myself.<|endoftext|> It's great they see you as a valuable employee, but don't you think it's a little too much taking advantage of their opinion on you with a fake disability? How about owning up to your image and being honest, so they have more reason to look up to you.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I know most people do not approve of this action but I don't care anymore.<|endoftext|> You may not care about your surroundings, but subjecting other people to your farts and pretending it was your baby disgusts others around you. Hold your gas until you can get to the bathroom.<|endoftext|>"

If you have to lie about it, then there might be something wrong with your beliefs if you can't stand your ground with it.

I'm not sure if they are doing that because my symptoms is actually getting better or they don't think they are working on me anymore.<|endoftext|> I understand you might feel lonely because it seems like no one's paying attention to you, but lying to medical personnel and wasting their time is bad.

        "dialogue": "It's not like I do that every time I'm at the doctor.<|endoftext|> I find faking symptoms for attention will always end up backfiring and you will end up losing friends because of it. Honesty goes a long way and you will be happier later on once you manage your issues. Loneliness is just a by product sometimes, and it will eventually solve itself once you realize what you want in life.<|endoftext|>"

Maybe with your imagination you can try to write a book or a script for a movie so that your creative mind can also be seen by other people. Think about it, okay?<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "He just made my friend worse.<|endoftext|> If you feel this strongly, then stop hanging around these people. No one should feel obligated to hang with people who make them feel mad or feel miserable.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I honestly do not even remember how i got there.<|endoftext|> If someone has thrown something away, it is acceptable to believe that it was not wanted. Finding treasure in another person's trash is okay but you shouldn't make a habit out of it. Your neighbors may get offended if they see you going through their trash.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "That's okay with me. Some of them are assholes anyway.<|endoftext|> Well you can take these things from the trash cans however you should probably be careful. Trash cans can be pretty nasty and may even contain some dangerous materials that are sharp.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Yeah the problem is unrelated to her so hopefully she will be ok with it.<|endoftext|> I think she will understand that if you tell her that the problem is not about her and very personal.

        "dialogue": "She said it wasn't and kept trying to talk me into paying for it.<|endoftext|> Well if you know for a fact that they made a mistake than you are right for not paying.

        "dialogue": "So I'm a 28 year old kid who is immature and antisocial.<|endoftext|> I don't really think so, don't beat yourself up like that!

If you expose her to alcohol she could lose all progress in her recovery.<|endoftext|>"

I want to see if he has more tears, like if he cries any more, will the tears have blood in them?<|endoftext|> Well, you said he WAS your friend.

Many families have been impacted by loss due to 9/11 and making light of what happened makes it more difficult for them to  accept what happened and psychologically recover.

I always want to appropriate things from foreign cultures.<|endoftext|> Ebonics is a dialect of English just a valid as other English dialects.

It can be possible that the problems you have mentioned are not on the priority list of feminists but it doesn't mean that they do not support them.

It's just a game and it's no big deal.<|endoftext|> Knowing that a family member has alzheimers should make you more motivated to look out for and protect that person.

My family is the reason why I was suffering so much in school.<|endoftext|> It's bad that your family caused you problems in your earlier life, but you should not take your current family for granted now.

I will torture them until they ask me to leave them.<|endoftext|> It is wrong to want to harm your family, physically or mentally.

Yes black people went through sad stuff, but it happened too long ago, it's not a big deal.<|endoftext|> It is a big deal, and declaring that racist jokes aren't racist or don't matter is just making the problem worse.

        "dialogue": "Having a daughter is the only thing that might explain his behaviour<|endoftext|> His behavior can be annoying but you should understand that he has no other options, leaving his daughter alone is not an option for a parent of a small child.

        "dialogue": "I'm going to call the police<|endoftext|> There's no reason to call the police for that, and if it really bothers you then you could just tell him that it makes you uncomfortable or wait for the young daughter to leave.

Anime is gross and I was dumb when I used to watch it and anyone who still watches it is dumb.<|endoftext|> Perhaps you just had a bad personal experience with anime. I'm not an expert, but isn't anime just some cartoons? Instead of focusing your anger on people who like anime, perhaps try to focus on something that you personally enjoy.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I think it would be funny.<|endoftext|> Seeing someone slip on a banana peel is quite funny, but you shouldn't laugh at your girlfriend if she does so. Laughing at her isn't very nice, and it's quite painful to slip and fall. You should be more sympathetic towards her, otherwise she might break up with you.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm sure she'll be fine and we'll both have a good laugh over it.<|endoftext|> Your girlfriend could fall and hurt herself if she slips and that wouldn't be very funny.

You see, I don't want to be too attached to her, she's just a person who is a friend.<|endoftext|> Although it is nice of you to bake a cake for your girlfriend, you should still take into account the time it takes. Being late to her party could cause her to be disappointed in you and give her ammo in the future.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I've made my first cake ever and I hope she likes it.<|endoftext|> What you are doing is nice, but it is also important to be on time to her party.   Being late could offset her which would make the cake matter less.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't want people who need help to feel like I'm selfish...<|endoftext|> You have no real duty to help everyone who is homeless, but it depends on their situation and yours.

        "dialogue": "I try to be honest with myself. I know my life would be better if I were white, so why shouldn't I hate my race?<|endoftext|> It's understandable if the pressures from the world are negatively affecting your self image. However, you should not hate your own race. Instead, talk with others of your race about how they deal with the pressure.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "If they can help me stop despising my race, then I will gladly do it.<|endoftext|> I'm really happy to hear you say that. I think you'll learn a lot by speaking to other people about coping with the pressures of a biased society, while managing to love their race.<|endoftext|>"

    },

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "The toilet being so white made me think of a KKK member, that's why I smashed it.<|endoftext|> Thinking that a toilet is racist because of its color makes no sense.

        "dialogue": "Because they're all sluts and should be treated that way.<|endoftext|> You might not consider that there is a large distinction between the words \"women\" and \"female\" to describe gender but there is and using the word \"female\" can make others feel objectified and uncomfortable. Instead of using depersonalized language and slurs to refer to women, try to interact with them respectfully in social situations.

You need to be respectful of others on the road and especially for people that are going to bury their loved one. We need to think about others more than ourselves when we're on the road.<|endoftext|>"

Crunch berries are really scary and I fear for my life.<|endoftext|> If you are that concerned about the cereal, you should go to a doctor and have them check your for allergies. That way you will know for sure that you are not allergic to anything in the cereal. If after that you still can't eat the cereal, you should consider seeing a psychiatrist since it's not normal to be so afraid of eating cereal.<|endoftext|>"

However maybe his head's so small that he has to stick it out so he can see over the distance.<|endoftext|> It's not really fair to criticize someone because of their height as it is something that he or she cannot control. Using terms like \"manlet\" can be very emotionally draining to hear for short people and can cause a lot of body issues and resentment.

If they are going to fire me they should come up with a better reason and not because of this.<|endoftext|> They might not fire you directly for cheating, but if you are missing skills or knowledge that could harm your future, then having cheated instead of learning will be harmful.<|endoftext|>"

If you need to report it, then do so and the police will take care of the paintings.

        "dialogue": "What are you getting at? Do you think I've committed a crime?<|endoftext|> Not a crime, but I'm sure your actions will hurt your girlfriend very much. You should come clean and tell her the truth about what you've done.<|endoftext|>"

Look at that group of people, what do you think?<|endoftext|> Assuming a group of people to be criminals makes them tend more towards doing crimes.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "F*** you guys.<|endoftext|> Well you can ask but if it is really close to the wedding date you should hold off for now. If it is a few months out they will have time to order extra food and get the seating right.<|endoftext|>"

You know this term is considered racist and it is not acceptable to use this terminology on people.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Fuck that. I wanna say it.<|endoftext|> You may want to call people disparaging names, but calling people these potentially racist names is hurtful. See if you can find ways to connect with people in a kind way rather than offending them.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "A family is loyal and keeps strong together, beating each other is normal.<|endoftext|> It is best to respect your siblings and let them know they are safe around you. That way you can trust and count on each other.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Because he left the party early when he was supposed to help her move<|endoftext|> He might have had a good reason leave the party early. It's not going to look good to your girlfriend if you are upset at her friends. If she isn't mad you shouldn't worry about it.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Sorry, It just bothers me.<|endoftext|> If your girlfriend is not upset about him being not able to help her move,  you have no reason to get bothered about it. Probably you should help her move.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "They are just pissing me off. When I was in hard shit and needed help, no one helped me. Why do I have to help a guy in his moment of need?<|endoftext|> I am sorry that people did not help you when you need it but you should help in this situation. It was a matter of life or death and you would feel bad if they died.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "He gets so much attention just for being autistic and no one pays any attention to me, and I'm depressed.<|endoftext|> It's okay to be frustrated, but autism is a serious condition and there is no reason for you to take out your anger on that student. This disabled kid is probably going through a hard time and you should try being nice to them. Perhaps your kindness will also help out with reducing your own depression.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't think I have depression.<|endoftext|> I know it's hard to admit your depression. If you can't find it in yourself to alleviate your depression, seeking therapy can be very beneficial to you in that it would help you with your depression, but also help you to potentially change your views on autistic people.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Consent means sex. If the woman gives no consent, it is rape<|endoftext|> Sexual assault is damaging to a person and joking about it the victim calling for help can trigger a person.

        "dialogue": "I don't think you can help me. I've been trying for years, maybe it's time to seek help from professionals.<|endoftext|> That the best way to handle your problems if your friends can't help you. They have the experience and knowledge to help people like you.<|endoftext|>"

You need to learn to relax a little.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I hate them!<|endoftext|> If you must, hate the individual at least and not the whole group.  There's no reason to extend an incident with one person into an indictment of a whole group of people, that's just bigoted!<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I was drunk and just forget where I had placed them.<|endoftext|> While it is okay to drink in moderation, it's wrong to drink to the point where you black out and not remember where you have left your belongings. You might need help with keeping your drinking under control. If you frequently black out during drinking you should contact a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous for help.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't fucking have time for AA. Quit acting like you know what's best for me.<|endoftext|> This may be something that shows you that you need to be super careful with your things when you are drinking. If you find that you forget things when you begin to drink, it may be good to simply place them somewhere you know well before even starting.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Blame the chink for playing badminton rather than focusing on muay thai.<|endoftext|> Using these kinds of racial slurs against any group perpetuates past racism, and so it is a bad idea to joke about them.  Furthermore, celebrating violence against racial groups, even if a joke, gives people a very bad impression about what you might really believe.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't want to get a totally mature dog.<|endoftext|> You should be willing to love all animals, even more mature ones, because they also need homes. With that said though, if you really want a younger dog then you should get one because you need to get a pet that you're willing to love or else you will just treat it poorly.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "As long as the dog is cute, I don't really care.<|endoftext|> Most mature dogs are just as adorable as puppies, but ultimately you should try to find a dog that's a good match for you so the transition into your home and life will be easy and you'll have a loving relationship with the pet. Dog's are long term commitments and you need to be able to love and support it for years to come.<|endoftext|>"

    },

        "dialogue": "He did it wrong first, so I showed him how by doing them myself and he got pissed.<|endoftext|> Having a boyfriend that call you bad names for the way you handled the dishes is wrong, but you calling him worthless just accelerates the cycle of animosity between you guys. If your man treats you like this, just get out and move on with your life.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I'm going to ruin his life, I know he likes me and he won't be able to take his anger out on me for too long.<|endoftext|> You need to work out your issues and stop fighting.

The people say there are only 2 genders but that's not true and they get offended when u say there r over 50 0r 100 genders.<|endoftext|> I think it is unfair that you compare the twin towers to genders today.

        "dialogue": "I'm saying that I would like to see Cartoon Network filled with child molesters.<|endoftext|> That guy committed heinous acts of sexual abuse on children and it's not appropriate to make jokes about what he did as it trivializes what happened to his victims and makes light of the serious crime of pedophilia. Trivializing of such things should be avoided since it it can impede people from coming forward about the abuse they have received and getting the help that they need. Instead of joking about sexual abuse, why not be an ally for victims of it and be more supportive?<|endoftext|>"

Don't listen to the garbage that people give you about race and laziness.<|endoftext|>"
    },

He even stumbles in the crosswalk when he crosses the street, isn't that really annoying?<|endoftext|> A driver's license takes time and effort to receive. You shouldn't try to get your friend's license revoked as it will cost him a lot of time and money to get back.

Sheesh.<|endoftext|> Although it was a joke, most people would be upset if they heard a joke about having sex with a corpse.

        "dialogue": "You're probably just jealous.<|endoftext|> I'm not jealous at all that you're going to be rude. You need to care more about the feelings of others, because imagine how bad it would be if someone said a bunch of hurtful things at you for a small infraction.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm working in the same job with him for years and I feel like he's taking my reputation because he got promoted before me. Its just not fair.<|endoftext|> You shouldn't badmouth coworkers because most of the time people will find you to be unrelatable and devious. Plus it comes off as a bit unprofessional. Therefore, it might even make it harder for you to get that promotion because people including your manager will just feel you are a person with too much negativity.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "F***k this. I should just sabotage his work.<|endoftext|> I can understand your frustration, but it is unprofessional of you to talk badly about your coworkers with their boss.

        "dialogue": "I think they were just joking around, they were priests after all. It's not like they were going to rape that kid with all those guys around.<|endoftext|> Making light of rape trivializes the harm it causes to its victims. If they heard someone joking about rape they'd feel angry and belittled. It would also remind them of the trauma they endured.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Just because you never had sex with a priest doesn't mean you can't make a joke about it. I can't take your opinion seriously if you can't see the good in what they did.<|endoftext|> Rape is a serious crime with real victims.

        "dialogue": "I would rather send the email now and get a lot of replies.<|endoftext|> Okay so send it out but be prepared that you might continue to be nervous about sending emails in the future still.

        "dialogue": "It's just a fact that Jews are smarter than non-Jews.<|endoftext|> Even though you're being positive, it can still be a negative stereotype towards Jews.

        "dialogue": "I don't get it? I'm just pointing out that for some people, their latin culture is more important than their job.<|endoftext|> You shouldn't stereo type people for enjoying food from their culture. What you're saying implies that latinos would drop and responsibilities in order to partake in something with their culture.

I must be prepared to be on my own.<|endoftext|> Having children is a large responsibility and it's understandable that you want your wife to reach certain goals before starting a family. If there are issues with how your wife takes care of herself, you should talk with a professional like a family planning counselor so that those issues can be brought up in a nonjudgmental environment.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't care if they kick me out. Food is cheap.<|endoftext|> It doesn't need much efforts to pick the food up if you dropped it. It's not about if the food is cheap or not, it's about correcting your own mistake. You need to change your attitude.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "She was being very rude to me, she's trouble.<|endoftext|> It's not nice to be rude to someone, but going off on them doesn't solve anything. Have you tried talking to her? Maybe she has a reason for being rude to you or perhaps she didn't realize she was being that way.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "She knew, I told her to stop being rude and that I don't like it. She ignored me and I felt like I had to go off on her.<|endoftext|> It is understandable to be upset when they are ignoring you but you shouldn't go off on them. It will make them less likely to want to be around you or to have a conversation with you.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Did you know African people are inferior to Europeans?<|endoftext|> If you have a problem with Africans why would you go to Africa? And then to be racist on top of it all.

        "dialogue": "Nah that's too much work. It's my mom after all.<|endoftext|> That is why you should apologize. It is your mother and I am sure she means a lot to you, and you to her.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "What are you trying to imply? It's just a joke, they are all animals.<|endoftext|> It would be of great benefit to you to learn how poorly black people have been treated throughout history.

    {
        "dialogue": "She's just a fat ugly pig and I hate it.<|endoftext|> Wanting your wife to be healthy is understandable, but you should be supportive and not speak of her so poorly.

        "dialogue": "I can't help that I'm scared of the weight coming back. I don't want her to be ugly again.<|endoftext|> It's not right to call your wife ugly just because she may have gained some weight. How would you feel if she called you ugly?<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm going to tell him my brother kissed me the night he got drunk.<|endoftext|> I understand you may want to confide in your boyfriend, but some secrets need to stay secrets. You getting kissed by your brother is truly devastating, and it can change how your boyfriend views you two.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "Whatever the company sent me that gift for free and with no strings attached.<|endoftext|> I see, then I really think there is no reason not to accept it and then return it. Hopefully you can get something you really want instead.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "The difference between Saying I seen and I saw is the same as the difference between X-ray and x-rayed.<|endoftext|> People use grammar based on their environments and upbringing. You should avoid judging others by how they speak. Doing so will demonstrate your lack of understanding when it comes to cultures.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "You are not understanding. I want people to learn the proper English grammar.<|endoftext|> That's a noble but unnecessary goal. Proper grammar is only a requirement in professional communications. We usually let grammar rules slide in everyday speech.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I will consider it then. We'll see next year.<|endoftext|> I hope that you do give this some serious thought, and consider how badly it could turn out for you when others react to what you have done. Furthermore, I hope that you don't wait all year, and that you come back whenever you want to ask about something.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I feel embarrassed but this is the real me. I'm a natural born pisser.<|endoftext|> You shouldn't call yourself that. It was an accident and it could happen to a lot of people.

        "dialogue": "I'm only trying to do the right thing but you don't understand.<|endoftext|> Ethical hacking can be a confusing concept for some. As long as you are doing it legally with training, it can really help a company!<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I think it was an accident but I am still angry about it.<|endoftext|> It is wrong to be mad at a family member for their religion. You can have your turn to convince him after about religion.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Yes, cause he gave me a virus on my computer and I tell you it's not very pleasant.<|endoftext|> It sounds like he screwed up and it's understandable that you're angry at him. But I don't think it's nice of you to call him names and rather just help him try to fix the issue instead. It's definitely better than not talking about it at all!<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "That's true. I'm going to call him a stupid piece of shit then say sorry to him when he realizes he fucked up.<|endoftext|> I do not think insulting him will make him realize that he did something wrong.

        "dialogue": "I think women should be immobilized and unable to think so that I can treat them how I want to.<|endoftext|> It is inappropriate to believe that women should be treated like objects for you to do what you want with them. It's never appropriate to think of another human being in this way. Being a man gives you no right to think of women in this way.<|endoftext|>"

I was happy about her passing really.<|endoftext|> Being somewhat relieved over a parents death is okay, but not grieving at all over your mom's passing away shows a lack of conscience. Spend time reflecting on your mother and what she meant to you instead of glossing over her death.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Her place was bigger and I made that decision without her because I need as much room as possible and she might not have let me.<|endoftext|> If you need more space, you should have spoken with her first.

        "dialogue": "I don't know why, I just feel like his life is ruining mine.<|endoftext|> It's understandable to want to part ways with a friend that you feel is holding you back, but choose an opportune moment to do so. If you already agreed to be someone's designated driver, then it's your responsibility to ensure that they get home safely.

I heard his son was in advance level of maths these days.<|endoftext|> I'm sorry, but it's your friend's trip too and he can decide who can and cannot go. It's not nice to dictate who can come or not. He possibly wants his son to make lots of good memories, you shouldn't prevent that.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Probably, I wish I was a prettier person.<|endoftext|> I'm sure you're beautiful, but making friends based on one's level of attractiveness is superficial and you deserve better than that. You should try to meet people who share common interests.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "There's not going to be any Christmas without an exercise bike.<|endoftext|> You can ask for what you want for Christmas, but expecting it to happen is kind of rude. What you're asking for may be hard to get, or too expensive. You should buy something yourself if you desperately want it, instead of relying on the good will of others.<|endoftext|>"

I told her my honest opinion and she just doesn't listen to me.<|endoftext|> I understand you care for your friend and don't want want her to get abused. it's not in your hands to make decisions.

The girl wanted it and she loved it<|endoftext|> If this is something that your girlfriend actually thought was funny, then that is between the two of you, and you shouldn't be saying these things publicly.  It sounds like you are announcing that you like to rape women.  Imagine if you had been arrested for something, you wouldn't want another inmate to take this kind of attitude toward you, so you shouldn't think of women that way.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "All women are cheaters are disloyal. They need to just obey their husbands and stop being selfish.<|endoftext|> Insinuating that women only care about themselves makes it seem like you believe they are selfish and is a generalization. Generalizing people can make your opinions come off as ignorant and uninformed. Try learning more about women and seeing for yourself how most act before generalizing them.<|endoftext|>"

She's too picky with food.<|endoftext|> It can be frustrating when people don't want to try your food but you shouldn't force people to eat it when they don't want to. They might throw up if they are forced to eat it.<|endoftext|>"

The relation between size and standing by the sink means that all women should stay physically near the sink to be clean.<|endoftext|> Women and men are alike even when society tends to make it seem like women are worth less than men and should only be in the kitchen. You should read up on the things that have been accomplished by women so you can understand all that they have achieved.<|endoftext|>"

I am tired of having to walk all the way up when other people could just walk one floor.<|endoftext|> I understand why you're annoyed, but you shouldn't judge others for using the elevator, even if it is only for one floor. You don't know if they're injured or have some condition that makes it difficult for them to walk up stairs.

Hearing such jokes can also bring about a lot of emotional pain for people who have had a friend or relative affected by a school shooting. Instead of joking about tragedies, it would be better to find lighter subject material to joke about so that people aren't put off by what you say and avoid your company.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Maybe, no one likes pain anyway.<|endoftext|> I am sorry that you are in pain, but it can be managed by a professional if you listen closely to their advice. Try to see what could be interfering with the pills and make sure to follow your doctor's advice strictly.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "They were together for a long time so there is nothing wrong with me to peek into their conversations. I just want to see what goes through his head<|endoftext|> You should get to know your boyfriend for who he is now, not who he was with someone else. It's wrong of you to read his messages because these were conversations he had before you both were together.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Possible, but I think they will be uncomfortable around her.<|endoftext|> At the end of the day it's your girlfriend, someone that potentially might spend the rest of her life with you. That's said who cares about your family. You should support you partner and who knows maybe your family will like her anyways regardless of the difference in political stance.<|endoftext|>"

I think it's best if I don't bring her to family gatherings<|endoftext|> I feel you should think on this, if you keep your girlfriend away from your family she'll never get to know them.

Taking care of someone is a difficult job, and you should be supportive of your mom for doing such demanding work.<|endoftext|>"
    },

He sees more graphic detail on television<|endoftext|> I feel like your son will not understand the movies and think of them as normal behavior and he may end up normalizing the actions of the actors in those R-rated movies and you will end up having a son that will not have good values when he grows up, so I suggest you don't do what you're planning.<|endoftext|>"

He wouldn't understand the movies anyways.<|endoftext|> You're right that he wouldn't understand it, but may think that those movies are normal and will end up being confused about what is right from wrong, and it may ruin his understanding of things.

        "dialogue": "I'm a vigilante cat mother. I care about the cats welfare.<|endoftext|> I understand that you are passionate about cats, but don't you think it goes against your mantra if you lie about the welfare of other cats? Why not just be honest to the watch group, and tell what's really going on? Maybe some better action can be reached with it.<|endoftext|>"

Be open and tell her you are confused about your feelings. It only means you and her both are open to others and dating them instead which can be fun.<|endoftext|>"

I'm trying to find a way to spend less time with him.<|endoftext|> Yes, it would be healthier for both of you if you both find people to hang out with separately.

        "dialogue": "I wanted to stay at home and watch a TV series.<|endoftext|> Just because you want to sit around and watch TV doesn't justify telling a fib to your dad so you don't have to work. Tell him the truth and take the consequences of your actions.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I can't believe you are not supporting my bad decision.<|endoftext|> I'm not supporting your decision because lying is wrong, but it's especially wrong to lie to your dad about your friend dying. If you wanted to take a day off work you should have told him the truth, because lying will only cause him to not trust you.<|endoftext|>"

He damaged our friendship forever.<|endoftext|> Being upset at your friend for \"stealing\" the girl out from under you sucks but it's not worth the effort to mess with their relationship, especially if he already ruined your friendship. You should just move on because she was probably not a relationship worth pursuing. Getting involved with people who are already involved with someone else will just make matters even more complicated and messy.<|endoftext|>"

Scammers should always be reported so that they can be identified and punished. Failing to do so would jeopardize the long term survival of government aid programs.<|endoftext|>"

I will though since she is so old and no longer young and beautiful like me.<|endoftext|> You are angry at someone because they are old and ugly, but one day you will be too.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Nah, I don't want to talk to him, I want her.<|endoftext|> Seeing as you're no longer friends with her ex, going after her is a bit okay.

        "dialogue": "They are  sinners who will face eternal damnation.<|endoftext|> Sex and gender are not interchangeable terms, and there is no generally accepted definition of gender, because the concept itself is not static but dynamic.

        "dialogue": "You guys are the ones who don't understand. Raping a girl is no big deal, it's just like farting.<|endoftext|> Comments that suggest that rape is not a big deal shows a lack of understanding about rape.

        "dialogue": "I'm going to do it anyway.<|endoftext|> Look, you have to be respectful of government property. Those books were paid for by the taxpayers. It's wrong to vandalize them and make them unusable for others.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "None of them are obeying the law.<|endoftext|> That's sort of true because there are a ton of bad drivers, but when someone gives you a way on the road, that means they want you to take it. It's good driving etiquette, and most drivers do understand this and will try to do the right thing. Don't worry, no one will judge you if you accept the gesture because they all want you to take it.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I was just trying to tell you how hard it is to catch women.<|endoftext|> I see, but you shouldn't assume that women are getting away with human trafficking more often than man.

Gay sex is dirty anyways.<|endoftext|> Not all gay people like every sex act just like not all straight people like every sex act.

If I don't do well, I'll just have to retake classes next year.<|endoftext|> That is something that can definitely happen, but you don't have to keep beating yourself up over it.

I thought about hurting her, but yes, I was in love with her.<|endoftext|> When you cheat on someone you love, you're breaking the trust and dedication that they have put into you, and cause them to feel less valuable.

The costs of the cameras are reasonable and the benefits are obvious.<|endoftext|> There may be short-term benefits, but in the long-run, blackmailing your coworkers is a bad idea.

There are many reasons as to why a person practices their faith, and many logical and intelligent people also are religious.

Dealing with her lies is tiring and not fair to me.<|endoftext|> If you're really unhappy with the lies she's telling to you then maybe it's time for you to end the relationship and move on.

        "dialogue": "I guess you're right. People do weird things sometimes.<|endoftext|> That they do. If you still need to talk to her about it just ask her why she did it in your bed.

        "dialogue": "Yeah I'm going to tell her that online postings are always permanent<|endoftext|> That's very kind of you to alert her about how her behavior is being perceived.

        "dialogue": "I want my car repaired for free.<|endoftext|> It would be great if we could get our cars repaired for free, but the truth is that it is a hard job and requires a lot of specialized parts, so it is expensive even for honest mechanics.

I didn't want to be out of donuts in my house, so I thought it would be a good idea to lick the donut and buy a different one.<|endoftext|> Why couldn't you just have bought the donut instead?

I don't know why you aren't supporting me, you should be happy I don't want to use a donut instead.<|endoftext|> Do you know that if you're caught doing something like that, you could end up in prison? There are a lot of diseases that you could spread by licking a donut, and it could be considered a very bad offense. Does that seem worth it?<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Is it okay if I irrationally lash out at you?<|endoftext|> Thanks for asking, but nope. I think it would be better for you to relax and take a deep breath to think about why you feel this way. We don't always have to have strong connections with everyone, but do you think you can try a bit so maybe you can no longer feel alone?<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Leave me alone, I don't have time for this shit.<|endoftext|> You do understand that this type of thinking is racist right?

        "dialogue": "Well, you do the math. I'll be playing some video games now so don't bother me.<|endoftext|> It's wrong to make an assumption about some people's sexual lives due to their weight. Some fat people just choose not to have sex with people for their own reasons so it's wrong to label all fat people as incels.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "It's just a joke, chill out.<|endoftext|> You should never joke about what happens to victims of any violence, this will make anyone gasp.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "No, and he's not the man I though he was if he can't bother to pay the bills.<|endoftext|> I'm sorry your husband is making this decision. Perhaps you can talk to him and see what the reasoning is behind quitting his job, and whether he plans to get another job. Or perhaps you can find a job, even though you are pregnant.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Who are you? I just want my husband to start working again. He's making a big deal out of nothing.<|endoftext|> There is always a reason why a man would quit his job. Either he got a better job offer or the place is toxic. Talk to him about it and stop the assumption.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "His humming is annoying me.<|endoftext|> It's not okay to tell your partner what to do. If your mood is affected maybe you can wear headphones or go to a different room. Your partner might not appreciate being told what to do.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I think that is not a smart way to live. I want to control his life.<|endoftext|> You can't control what your partner does, but if you share how his behavior makes you feel, you might be able to convince him to stop humming around you. If you share that his humming is really bothering you, then he might voluntarily stop humming around you.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "What do you think about me buying a $4000 collectible polish military cap even though I'm seriously regretting my decision already?<|endoftext|> Why would you want to buy such an expensive hat?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't know it's just a fetish, I'm a fan of that<|endoftext|> If you are spending large amounts of money recklessly, then you should reconsider your choices. It is a good idea to think for a long while before making large purchases so you don't regret them. Buying something like a hat for a large amount of money could be considered a foolish purchase.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Fuck I wasted all my money.<|endoftext|> You should regret this, because wasting all of your money is a gross misuse of funds. You need to save your money and spend it wisely.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Because they are trolling and I really want for them to stop.<|endoftext|> I get that you want them to follow the rules, but still you should not do things like that. It is going to upset them if they get banned.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't care. I just want them to stop.<|endoftext|> If you want them to stop then you should try another way that doesnt include being banned from the game. If your family member was banned from they game odds are they would become very upset.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "We are always fighting and not getting along.<|endoftext|> I can help give you  some advice if that is what you are after. You need to end this relationship so you can move on and be happy with your life.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm just going to get some porn to jerk off to, no need to worry about my relationship.<|endoftext|> Please don't avoid it because it will just delay the inevitable. If you keep dragging this on you, it will be detrimental to your mental health, so if you're not happy, just end the relationship. It's better to rip off the band-aid than to slowly peel it off, right?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm going to tell a black woman that she's the first person of color my daughter has met who is pretty.<|endoftext|> Is there anything connected to your relationship with the black woman?<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "No, I just want to be honest.<|endoftext|> Your honest opinion is important to you. Use filters when you speak and think about what the words mean. Otherwise they can come off as really obnoxious and offend the various races people are.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Okay.<|endoftext|> Yeah the wording makes it sound quite racist. But it is good to complement people and tell them they look pretty. It can really boost someones confidence.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "He said I was was retarded, but he's unaware that I know about their conversation.<|endoftext|> It's understandable to be upset when someone talks behind your back, but its rude to read someone's private conversation without them knowing. If they find out you did this they will continue to make fun of you or worse.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "He made fun of me and I know what he's saying behind my back. He's stupid and I'll beat him up now to show the world that people shouldn't make fun of others.<|endoftext|> I understand you had reason to believe they were saying bad things about you. But that doesn't justify reading their private conversations.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Yes, depression is caused by how weak-minded you are.<|endoftext|> You are incorrect about depression and it is wrong to judge a person due to their mental illness. Instead of being ignorant and judgemental you should educate yourself on the topic of depression.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Ok, but I've never experienced depression.<|endoftext|> You should be thankful then. Some people say if feels like a pit with out hope. Some really dark feelings.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "You don't like the joke? It's just the truth. Do you love pedophile priests?<|endoftext|> Of course I don't love pedophilic priests. I just feel it's messed up to make fun of kids being preyed upon when it happens a lot in real life. Jokes like that can be really damaging to people that have gone through those kinds of traumatic experiences.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I believe that there is an afterlife.<|endoftext|> Why do you believe that there's an afterlife?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Because if there's no afterlife, life has no meaning.<|endoftext|> On the contrary, having no afterlife makes your current life  important because you know that you will not get any other lives after this one. So this life that you have is it's the one that actually has all the meaning. That should make you want to live a great and fulfilling life.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't think so, the only option is that there's an afterlife.<|endoftext|> You could be right about an afterlife existing and you could also be wrong. Everyone has the right to believe what is right for them and they are entitled to those beliefs. There is no absolute answer.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Because he is, who else would use gold to get whiter?<|endoftext|> Jokes like this perpetuate the harmful idea that Black people wish they could be white. This type of joke rests on the presupposition that blacks are inferior to whites, which is a racist stereotype. Try to consider how you would feel if people labeled your own race as inferior, and be more conscientious about the jokes you make in the future.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It's not a joke. It's a fact, you're saying I can't use it.<|endoftext|> It's wrong to assume that all black people want to be white, this is not a fact. Black people are happy to love who they are as a person and what they look like.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I thought about sending them to the laundry, but I figured I could clean them up myself.<|endoftext|> Lighting your sheets on fire to clean them is extremely dangerous. If you need to clean your sheets you should simply put them in the washer. If you continue lighting things on fire the them you most likely end up burning your house down.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Just because it's dangerous, that doesn't mean I shouldn't do it. Fun is all that matters in life anyways.<|endoftext|> Fire does not clean things; it only destroys things. Trying to clean your sheets by lighting them on fire was just destructive. Next time try the laundromat.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm afraid to be honest about my feelings.<|endoftext|> I understand it can be difficult to be open about how we feel.  But it's bad to lead people on in relationships and can end up with them being hurt.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Oh well I'm going to be honest with him that I'm done with him.<|endoftext|> That's good. You should always be honest and let people know when you don't have feelings anymore. That helps them move on, as you already have-- leading them on would just ruin months of their life.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Yes. And the reason is because of my need for revenge, she got what she deserved<|endoftext|> It is wrong to hurt and kill prostitutes. You can still go to prison if you hurt them. Maybe you should just stay away from prostitutes.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Nah. After dealing with that hooker. I'm going for my ex-wife.<|endoftext|> You are lucky if you aren't already in jail from what you did to your wife. If you keep up this streak of attacking your wives, don't you think you will eventually end up in jail? Then, you might regret your actions.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I was making a joke and you are taking it for real. I just meant that ...<|endoftext|> It is disrespectful to tell a women to go and live on mars just because of their voice. If you do not like their voice then you are right for changing the channel, but there is no need to harp on the fact that you dislike their voice. Someone's voice is not really something they can control about themselves.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Are you a feminist?<|endoftext|> It's wrong to judge people based on their sex. It doesn't matter if I am a feminist or not, but what matters is that people shouldn't make fun or ridicule a woman's voice just because they do not like it. I hope you'll reconsider your attitude towards the matter and be respectful towards all people, regardless of what they sound like.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "The shitty location, the incompetent boss and the late hours<|endoftext|> I understand that not all jobs are great, but you still have to respect your duty, position, and everyone in the company. You need to give notice to your leaving to be considerate of their time and yours. You don't want to look bad to other employers.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm mad. I shouldn't have to wait 7 days to quit a job. I'm leaving right now.<|endoftext|> Usually people give notice when they leave a job so their employer is not left in a bind. It would be better for your reputation if you could give some notice.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "I can't speak to something they don't know about.<|endoftext|> I'm pretty sure the therapist will definitely try to understand you if they don't know about it! You have to try, because being racist can be quite harmful to you and others around you.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "It makes me uncomfortable and I'm not going to let my husband control me.<|endoftext|> Wedding rings have a lot of significance and it would be upsetting for your husband to know that you don't want others to know that you are married. It will lead to fights and problems in the marriage.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't care. I don't need this symbol to show that I'm committed.<|endoftext|> Rings are only a cultural tradition.

        "dialogue": "I don't care about north korea<|endoftext|> It's good that you keep up with political issues, but you can't expect everyone to know the same things as you do. Instead of laughing at people who don't know, try teaching them something.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "North Korea has never affected my life and I'm happy about it.<|endoftext|> Even if it's never affected your life you clearly feel a certain way about the country. If you have something to say then speak up. Laughing at people without giving an actual reason is just going to annoy others.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Yeah, I don't really like italian people, they're rude and backstabbing.<|endoftext|> You should be aware of your audience when telling jokes. And stereotyping is wrong even if it's about your own group. Not everyone has the same sense of humor.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Maybe I should make a joke about another culture then.<|endoftext|> Some people might be offended by your joke. You should try to feel out a room before you preform the joke because you may be heckled or it could fall flat.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I was having a difficult time passing my spanish class, so I ended up resorting to taking harder drugs to get by.<|endoftext|> Oh no. You do not seem all that happy. Can you let me know how you are doing in class?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I am really not doing all that well in class as I started to skip it.<|endoftext|> If you are struggling to learn using drugs is counter productive. You should ask for help if you really need it and not turn to a crutch.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It calms my nerves. They make the world look more colorful.<|endoftext|> The more you use drugs like this the more you will begin to rely on them. You do not want to get to the point of relying on drugs as this is when you become addicted.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm going to accuse my boyfriend of cheating with another woman.<|endoftext|> Is there a reason you think he's cheating on you?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "No, but maybe he'll admit to something if I accuse him.<|endoftext|> If you don't have any evidence that he is cheating then you shouldn't make that accusation. It sounds like you need to develop the trust in this relationship.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I think I'll make an accusation anyway.<|endoftext|> Accusing someone of cheating without proof seems like a good way to end a relationship. How would you feel if he accused you of cheating?<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Why do I love my wife , daughter and granddaughter equally? A good father should love all of his children equally .<|endoftext|> Is it bad to love people equally?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "No, I mean to say, I love all of my children and show no favorites.<|endoftext|> There is nothing wrong with loving people equally. It should be like that, no more, no less.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "He can afford it and I need the money.<|endoftext|> You shouldn't lie about getting overpaid. He will eventually find out and you'll be in trouble with your boss.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Screw that! I'm not going to tell him. He'll never know.<|endoftext|> Your boss will eventually find out that you received more money than you were supposed to and it's wrong not to tell him about it just so you can get some extra cash. If you value your job, you will come clean.<|endoftext|>"
    },

    {
        "dialogue": "I mean they're rich you know? I'm poor because of them.<|endoftext|> Someone else being rich isn't what makes you poor. It takes a good businessman to monetize things and a good worker to earn money. Maybe you should try to find a better job or an additional way to make money if you need more.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I just found out that she's been stealing from my electricity money to play bingo.<|endoftext|> I understand your frustration, it's not fair of your mother to spend your utility money on gambling. It's reasonable to want to restrict her access to online gambling, but you should also have a talk with her to let her know how this affected you.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "She stole for me and it wasn't right. She shouldn't have any access to bingo.<|endoftext|> You're right, it wasn't fair of her to steal your electricity money. You should look into resources to help her, as she may have an addiction to gambling.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "What do you think of me telling my daughter I don't want her to be a step parent?<|endoftext|> Is it because of the logistics of being a parent to a child, or just the thought of not having control over your kids life?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't like her step daughter and I think she doesn't deserve to live this life of taking care of her.<|endoftext|> You dislike your step daughter, but it's not your move to make regarding your own daughter's choices. Stay out of it, but be there to support your daughter. Getting yourself more involved will only make yourself seem like a meddler.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It's not up to me and my happiness matters than anyone else's.<|endoftext|> Your happiness is not more important than everyone else's and it's wrong to assume this. It's best that you respect your daughter's decision regarding her stepchild and not attempt to create conflict for her.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "My short hair is easier, but also I liked that it made me feel like I looked totally different.<|endoftext|> Getting a haircut after a relationship ends is pretty common. It's normal to want to change your look when you feel sad. But hopefully you'll be able to move on from the heartbreak soon.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "I meant to prove to myself that I can find someone better.<|endoftext|> You can change whatever you want about your appearance. IF it makes you feel better and boosts your confidence after a breakup, it's really good to change your appearance so it matches your new feelings.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I think she has a lot of influence over my fiancee and if she tells me something about what's going on I may be able to help her.<|endoftext|> If you are so concerned, you should talk to them both about it. Self harm is a serious issue and something that needs to be addressed before it becomes worse since it's a sign of mental health problems.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "You're right. I just want my fiancee to be happy and I'm worried about her.<|endoftext|> It's good that you are concerned about your fiancee. The best thing to do would be to talk to your fiancee about your concerns. Maybe you can encourage her to seek therapy or support.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Just a reminder to myself to make sure that I tell her.<|endoftext|> Oh okay, well that's fine. It's good that you want to remember to tell her you love her. Everyone should find ways to tell their partner that they love them.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "No, I can't stand being around my ex-wife.<|endoftext|> Before dating an ex's relative, you should have a conversation with your ex to see if they're OK with it. It's important to communicate honestly and openly about it to avoid hurt feelings.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't need to tell her. After all it's not like she gives a damn about me.<|endoftext|> She may be an ex wife, but don't you think it's more wise to just stay out of her life from now on? How is she going to feel that you are still around, but with her cousin instead? Maybe it's best to find someone else who isn't related to her.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "What!? I didn't mean it like that, asshole. Gay men are useless.<|endoftext|> it is not right to say that gay men are annoying. We should be accepting of others. There are many wonderful and interesting people that are gay and you should try to get to know some.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Yeah, just a little joke but I think they deserved it.<|endoftext|> The sad situation is that most people are poorly educated about the plight of the Jewish people during the holocaust. There is a great book called the diary of Anne Frank and I think you would get a lot out of that book. It's simply wrong to joke that Jewish people deserved the holocaust.<|endoftext|>"
