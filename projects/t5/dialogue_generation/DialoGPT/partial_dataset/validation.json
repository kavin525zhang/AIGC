    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Yes! not all but some are.<|endoftext|> Regardless of what these kinds of women do, it's not fair to label all of them like this. Going down to such a level will only hurt your credibility, and possibly your reputation with others if they hear these things from you.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I heard he got a bunch from his family lately.<|endoftext|> It is a crime to steal other peoples money and spend it. You should get a job or pack a lunch from home if you are hungry.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "So what, he needed to learn that his house can't buy everything. Feel bad for him? Please, he will survive.<|endoftext|> One day all this theft will catch up with you. You might think you can steal from the wrong person and they might hurt or kill you. You should really stop and maybe get a job if you need money so bad.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm a very insecure person.<|endoftext|> I understand you were probably in a vulnerable situation looking for companionship, but don't fall for just anyone because you know them.

        "dialogue": "It depends on the woman. Generally though, yeah, men are funnier.<|endoftext|> I don't think there's any difference between men and women in terms of how funny they can be. Thinking that women are less funny than men is a sexist attitude to have and makes it more difficult for women to be seen as equals in society.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "But I didn't say women couldn't be funny. I said that generally men are funnier and that is true.<|endoftext|> To you maybe but not everybody has the same sense of humor and just cause you don't like it doesn't mean that women are not funny. Maybe those women are funny to other women or other people.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "A person who was a part of my past hurt me so badly I still remember it and think about it.<|endoftext|> It's okay to still feel hurt from painful situations in the past that you haven't healed from. Instead, of holding on to those painful feelings, you should ask yourself what you have learned from the past so that you can begin moving forward.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I got very caught up in the moment. I'll just need to punish that person really hard.<|endoftext|> You still have so much pent up anger and it is understandable. It's not good if you still feel like you want to hurt someone from long ago. You should see a therapist that specializes in trauma and try to get past this.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "Obviously if you're black, you are either poor and/or don't take care of your kids. Or maybe you're a criminal.<|endoftext|> Sometimes people lose their jobs and are unable to provide for their families. Black people are not the only one susceptible to these conditions. Instead of insulting, lend them a hand with some generosity.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "What are you talking about?<|endoftext|> I mean that what you are referring to is racist. You cannot say that all black men cannot take care of their kids. It is not something that we should think in 2022.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Her dad was an asshole to me. I think he was absolutely creepy, he was so damn full of himself!<|endoftext|> I'm sorry that her dad wasn't the best to you, but you have to do it for the sake of her and her family, not for her dad himself. You need to show your respect to them, not him. Otherwise they'll think you're selfish and uncaring.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I dunno. I'm thinking about just showing up with my gf's all draggin' ass.<|endoftext|> You're thinking right. Even if you don't like your gf's dad, you need to go. There's no harm in it.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I think that from the tradition of the Catholic church to the present, the church has been a highly sexually charged place and priests were once considered to be sexual predators.<|endoftext|> I don't think it's right to mark priests as a whole are sexual deviants abusing their authority. The actions of a few do not speak for the many upstanding priests. Would you want to be marked as a pedophile because some people similar to you were pedophiles?<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Yes I'm going to be a reason of him being so depressed. It is he who has a problem not me.<|endoftext|> It's unfortunate that this other student feels depressed, but cheating is wrong and is a violation of academic ethics. It's up to do as to whether you report the student, but you would not be wrong to do so, as they unfairly benefited off of your hard work.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It's okay since I don't care about him.<|endoftext|> Well I think reporting it is the best course of action, but maybe you can talk to him about his depression and try and get him to seek help.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "The boy has cost me plenty of money, the government should pay the bill. The school also should pay for it.<|endoftext|> Hurting someone is wrong. Pushing him would in no way help your finances but could send you to jail.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "What if we pay someone to beat the living shit out of that freak?<|endoftext|> That would not be good either. And none of them will help with the money problem. Pushing people is no way to solve problems in your life and it will just cause more.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "You tell me to be gentle!<|endoftext|> You should definitely be gentle and nurturing with your child. Hugging a child too tightly will make the child feel uncomfortable. You can seriously hurt a child by doing this.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "I'm yet to meet a homosexual person that wouldn't have sex in my closet. It's all masturbation<|endoftext|> I don't think it's right for you to make jokes which imply that gay people are overly sexual. These kinds of jokes are based on stereotypes which simply aren't true, and are harmful. I think it would be better if you stopped making these jokes.<|endoftext|>"

It makes it bearable for me to sit still on plane for so long.<|endoftext|> I understand wanting to keep yourself entertained on such a long flight, but it is rude to do something that could disturb others. Maybe you can listen to an audiobook to pass the time.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "You're just a hater. I can do whatever I want.<|endoftext|> I'm not a hater, but people will believe that you are if you're trying to disturb people on a flight when they're trying to sleep.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Yeah, and I feel so much better when I reject someone.<|endoftext|> Rejecting people is part of dating, but you shouldn't get joy out of it. It's mean and this attitude will make people think you're a bully.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm going to reject everyone who isn't a hottie.<|endoftext|> It seems as if you almost reject people for pleasure and that is wrong. It's fine if you don't like someone, but I'd encourage you to reevaluate your approach to dating and be more considerate of the feelings of others.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I dunno, I just feel that I could trust her. She seems like such a kind girl.<|endoftext|> It's natural to have a good feeling about someone but you shouldn't put too much trust in them if they haven't earned it yet. You might become upset if they end up proving you wrong and betraying that trust later down the line.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I feel I'll know when the time will come when I could trust her.<|endoftext|> If you're having doubts about someone you shouldn't put all your trust in them right away. It looks like you are weighing on the side of waiting when the time will come and I think that will be beneficial for you.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I told my child there were monsters under the bed, so she was afraid there were.<|endoftext|> That sounds traumatic. Why would you scare your kid about things like that?<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "She wouldn't sleep with me, so I had to come up with an explanation why certain things can harm her at night<|endoftext|> You are lying to your child and scaring her on purpose. It is not appropriate for your child to sleep with you and tricking your child into wanting to sleep with you makes it even worse. Be honest with your kids and have them sleep in their own bed.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Why do I have to be honest with my children?<|endoftext|> Only because the adults in their lives are supposed to be role models and teach them right from wrong. So I think it's best to continue being honest, and apologize that you were lying. Your child will forgive you and learn the value of forgiveness!<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "It's like I see some weird shit and then people come out of it.<|endoftext|> That must be very scary! You should seek help for the hallucinations. You will feel much better when you are able to live without the hallucinations.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Fuck I need to figure out how to make them stop, they are not cool.<|endoftext|> Yea if you are constantly having hallucinations then getting help is paramount. You may be experiencing episodes of schizophrenia which is not something you want to wait on doing something about.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I just want to do some chores today. I will try to go tomorrow then.<|endoftext|> I think that therapy is so important. You should not cancel the appointment just because you want to clean up instead.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't like unnecessary things that don't directly benefit me.<|endoftext|> It's important to look ahead to the future. The therapy appointment will benefit you down the road. Chores will be there and chores will never be finished as it is a continual task that lasts until you die.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I just want to watch something cool and everyone is welcome to watch it too.<|endoftext|> It's fine to enjoy Netflix, but if you're in a shared space, it would be rude to force others to hear the dialogue without first asking if it's OK. What's wrong with just using your headphones?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Noise cancelling headphones are too expensive. I really want to watch this show.<|endoftext|> I know that noise-cancelling headphones are expensive, but surely you have a pair of standard earbuds that you can use. If not, you should either turn the volume down very low and use subtitles, or just wait until you are alone to watch. It is too inconsiderate to make others hear the noise of your programs.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't think there's a negative connotation if it's from a book.<|endoftext|> It might be okay to use it if it's in the book, but I would still be careful. In all other instances you definitely shouldn't use it, though.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I think I'm going to say it whenever I want, actually.<|endoftext|> I wouldn't do that, because it's a really offensive word and people might feel really upset if you say it. I think you should avoid using it altogether.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "He is an asshole sometimes.<|endoftext|> Even if you were mad, it's not okay to do things out of revenge to your brother. You should handle things with him in a mature manner.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I don't want to let him win.<|endoftext|> You are overreacting by deleting his progress. That can be really cruel to little kids. Why not tell your parents what is going on?<|endoftext|>"

I just want to help women who can't go to the bathroom by their own.<|endoftext|> Having the desire for other people to use the bathroom on you is very unique. It is not necessarily wrong, but you should be careful expressing it to others openly. You are free to pursue your fetishes as long as you obtaining consent and not harming anyone.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "You are right, what the hell am I thinking.<|endoftext|> Pulling a fire alarm when no fire is around is considered a crime, so I would advise against trying such a prank.

    {
        "dialogue": "Nah, I'm going to demand that she moves on her own first.<|endoftext|> It's understandable that you want your girlfriend to have some experience before you both live together.

        "dialogue": "Because I like abusing the system, I love pizza and the poor guy's didn't know it<|endoftext|> Cheating undermines social integrity, decreases trust, and thus damages society.

Just because someone is kneeling to prove a point or protest, does not mean that you should want to hurt them.

No one will know the truth.<|endoftext|> If you want to have the highest score, it would be best to just practice a whole lot until you are the best.

They should go to the kitchen instead of having people like me steal their food.<|endoftext|> Throwing food away is really not the best thing to do if it is not yours.

Not jealous because they aren't going so well for you. Maybe try working on why your family isn't as functional and you might get to a point where you're the one posting the pictures.<|endoftext|>"

Not every priest out there is evil, and the ones who did commit atrocities against children are in the most extreme minority.

Doing so denies their ability to be their true selves and is not okay to try to shame them for their actions.

        "dialogue": "I'm just going to buy beer over fruit and it will be fine. My kids will be fine without fruit.<|endoftext|> Your children will have bad eating habits. You need to teach them to eat healthy young so they do it when they are older.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I just want to enjoy myself. I earned it.<|endoftext|> In this case, since someone else paid for your vacation, I think you should stay, just to avoid appearing so ungrateful.  You can, however, say that you want to explore the local area by yourself, and then you can simply find a place to be alone and relax.  You might even enjoy yourself, and no one will be offended.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Ha! I'm laughing as RBR deletes my post for being racist, I know this site hates black people.<|endoftext|> The idea that Black people can play the race card to get special privileges is the notion that unfairly stigmatizes Black people. Consider how you would feel if you were told that you only got something because of your race, and not because of your merit. Try to be more considerate about how your words affect people of different races.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I want him to suffer so I'm going to tell him a week before that I want to break up and only then I'm going to kick him out.<|endoftext|> I do not think you really need to plan on doing it.

        "dialogue": "I did win.<|endoftext|> Having a fair competition requires all participants to be free of performancing enhancing drugs. It's wrong to take a substance that might give you an advantage over other participants. Instead, you should prepare yourself properly and physical for a sports competition.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "That is too mainstream. I support the use of steroids and banned substances in sports and in life.<|endoftext|> Even if you do support it, it is still against the rules of the competition.

        "dialogue": "I can't afford it but I wanted to be kind.<|endoftext|> Its ok to not want to pay for someone else's train card. It is not your duty to pay for it, so you are more than ok saying no. Strangers should not expect you to pay for their things anyway.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "You are just a mean person. Why would you make me feel bad if I'm being kind?<|endoftext|> I'm not meaning I'm just watching out for you so you don't get taken advantage of when you can't afford it. You are indeed too nice, so I want to stress that it's okay to say no. You are not a charity, right, and who is going to look out for you when you are broke?<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm not going to directly admit that, but I wouldn't deny it if someone accused me of it.<|endoftext|> Racial slurs like that have a very negative connotation and using them encourages violence and hatred toward black people. How would you feel if someone judged you for the color of your skin? I suggest reading up on the history of the racism that black people have faced so they can better understand why those words are offensive.<|endoftext|>"

I try to gift my wife the best gift I can give her.<|endoftext|> If you think that your ex is particularly skilled at finding the perfect gift for someone, and if you don't think it would be awkward to ask her, then it's fine to benefit from her advice. However, you wife might not want you to be spending too much time with an ex, so you should respect any potential concerns she might have.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I know it could lead to infidelity.<|endoftext|> So you're admitting you might cheat on your wife like this? I really think you shouldn't just try to consult a friend or family member instead, exes should stay in the past to prevent more harm from falling through.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I just want to find out what is going on. It will serve as a mean to know what they hide from me<|endoftext|> Mining your parent's phone to find out information is stealing from them. They don't have to tell you everything, and you don't have a right to know what they're hiding.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "They shouldn't hide things from me. It's not like I can get hurt and it's interesting to know.<|endoftext|> While it seems interesting and like a harmless thing, you shouldn't stalk people like that.

        "dialogue": "I love my dog so much, he is my life and I want him back.<|endoftext|> I can understand your feelings. It's right to take things back that are yours. You should let your ex know that he had no right to take him from you.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I can feel better as soon as I'm dead. Life is bullshit, nobody cares about me. I'm going to kill myself.<|endoftext|> I do not think that you should carry on feeling this way. I think that if you really feel that badly, that you should find someone to talk to. Talking to someone that is certified to help you can really be beneficial and improve your self image.<|endoftext|>"

I'll report him.<|endoftext|> What I mean to say is that you should report him to the school if he really is cheating or plagiarizing someone else's work. However, if you are just reporting him because you are angry, and he is actually innocent, then that will be worse than the crime itself. Ensure that justice is served, if necessary, but don't try to frame the innocent.<|endoftext|>"

It's not like I'm hurting anyone.<|endoftext|> Although you may not be physically hurting someone, if you are parked in a handicapped spot and someone who actually needs that spot shows up it will make things difficult for them.

It makes me feel like I'm already bulimic.<|endoftext|> You should reach out to someone close to you for help if you feel like you're developing an eating disorder.

        "dialogue": "I feel like it's my time to go and I don't care if I'm dead or in the hospital.<|endoftext|> It's not a good idea to abuse your prescriptions.

I'm pretty much my own husband now<|endoftext|> I think your reasoning for having a baby is not good; it's best to not bring a child into a relationship that's ending.

        "dialogue": "I wanted to act surprised with her, but I couldn't wait to see each episode.<|endoftext|> While in most situations, lying to your partner is bad, in this case it seems pretty harmless.

If you don't like your grandfather's beard you should talk to him about his appearance and make a suggestion for improvement. You might come to a compromise and find a beard style that both your grandfather and you would find acceptable.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "He's 6 years older than his brother.<|endoftext|> It might feel logical to give the business to your older child, but what does that leave the younger one with?

        "dialogue": "I don't feel that I owe him an explanation, we're done.<|endoftext|> I know how hard this is for you. You should just tell him directly how you feel and end the relationship.

I am an overweight,  transgender woman who hates white people<|endoftext|> I don't think it's helpful to be ashamed of yourself for being white.

        "dialogue": "I don't care. I pay for half of it anyway.<|endoftext|> There's no point in making everyone have a bad time on vacation because you're unhappy. If you feel that way, you should just skip the trip and let the other people have fun without you.<|endoftext|>"

Your girlfriend can be friends with whomever she wants, and it's not your place to tell her differently. If you don't like her friend then you should avoid him, but she's allowed to see him if she wants.<|endoftext|>"

I need to hurt her self-esteem now that she's strong enough to leave home.<|endoftext|> The way that you are raising your children is extremely harmful to them.

The world is becoming more integrated now, and globalization is taking place in Western countries so it is better to get along with others even if you don't look the same. You might be surprised on how well you get along with others and how much you might have in common.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I guess that I should keep my mouth shut.<|endoftext|> Not technically, keep your mouth shut, but be cognizant of the vibe you are giving off.

You should talk with your girlfriend and say that you are not feeling appreciated and are hurt that she is so critical of your gift.

        "dialogue": "The kid is fine and she's back home. She should not have any problems with me.<|endoftext|> I hope that this child will not have any more problems with you, but the fact that you did this deliberately is very troubling. I hope you understand that you were willfully trying to kill or injure an innocent child. If you ever get the urge to do something like that again, I suggest you talk to someone first.<|endoftext|>"

I feel like you really care about them and won't want them to feel embarrassed, so I think you're doing something commendable.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "You should still try to look at how upset they look or not.<|endoftext|> I do not feel like I would know anyway if they feel embarrassed or not, so I would just take your advice and not look at dogs when they pee, as they may not like it.

I really hate children.<|endoftext|> You hate children and want them to suffer, but that is quite mean. Harming things or people you hate is just not something that is part of what life is about. Be more concerned with your own likes and work with that in a positive way.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "If you kill a lot of people, you're a hero. Black people die more in murder events and terrorist attacks because they're involved in more crimes and this makes them the biggest mass murderers.<|endoftext|> This is a generalization about black people.

        "dialogue": "Yeah, because I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he tried to jump for it.<|endoftext|> It's nice that you wanted to give your dog a treat, but next time consider a treat that doesn't have so much sugar. Sugar isn't good for dogs, as their bodies aren't adapted to process it and they don't brush their teeth. If you want to give a good treat to your dog, try a piece of meat instead.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I just cant stand the way she treats them anymore.<|endoftext|> Well, if you really think she's being mean to them, then you should confront her about it.  Families sometimes have issues and the best way to work through them is to talk about it.  I hope it goes well!<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I was jealous of their relationship with each other.<|endoftext|> You are behaving immaturely and you have no right to tell anyone who they can be friends with. You have jealousy issues, you should stay out of the personal relationships of other people even if they are your friends or you will end up being the one that is excluded.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm only jealous because they don't care about me.<|endoftext|> I don't think that's true at all because they can care about each other and about you.

It was a gift, and gifts aren't supposed to be given back. I think you should just let it go, to keep the relationship good!<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I just wanted her to hate the cat as much as I do, but I have no guilt about it now.<|endoftext|> You hate cats and want your wife to as well, but that seems very mean. Cats are not the enemy, they can be good for your health to be around. They can help reduce stress levels.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Shut up cat lover, you better not report me for animal abuse.<|endoftext|> I certainly would report you if I thought you were abusing the cat. Hopefully you found the cat another home instead of getting rid of it in an abusive way.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "I trust her to get me there on time.<|endoftext|> Driving someone to the airport can be annoying but as a parent she should expect to do things she doesn't like to help you. It is expected to have a parent help you and then for you to help a parent later in life.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Should I ask her to drive me?<|endoftext|> Yeah, I think you should ask her to take you to the airport. I'm sure she'll be willing to do it, because parents generally help out their child if they're able.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Nothing major, I don't want to bother him, he's too busy and also, I don't like asking favors.<|endoftext|> Not wanting to bother your dad is respectable but getting your wife's name on the deed is important. Something like that should be taken care of as soon as you can so it doesn't cause any problems in the future. You shouldn't put off something important just because you're trying to be courteous.<|endoftext|>"

With that recognition you can go out and start to make changes to your behavior that will improve your maturity.

I'm not even a diehard hitler fan.<|endoftext|> Jokes about the holocaust aren't funny and only server as a reminder to the Jewish people regarding the atrocities they experienced as well as the soldiers and other people involved in that event.

Women are just emotional and should just stay at home.<|endoftext|> It is wrong to think of women as being weak and overly emotional. I feel like that's a strong sexist sentiment that you do not want to be spewing up and I suggest that you continue thinking about women as being strong and independent, so that you will be inspired to see that they are more than what you think of them.<|endoftext|>"

I think he is lying about me having a chance.<|endoftext|> I can understand that you are a bit upset about your friend liking the girl that you like, but blowing things out of proportion and cutting him off is not the way to handle it.

        "dialogue": "She asked me if she could leave the room and I yelled at her not to do it.<|endoftext|> Its good that you reprimanded your sister for walking around like that. She should try to conceal her body more when walking around her siblings.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I hate my sister for doing something like that to me.<|endoftext|> I'm sorry you had to see something that inappropriate, she needs to learn some privacy and boundaries. It's good you made a reaction, because siblings aren't supposed to see each other like that.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't know; I only know if a cop touches you and looks like you, you should be expecting a harsh justice, especially if you are black and all.<|endoftext|> It is not in good taste to joke about black people being killed by the police. In addition to that, making fun of the police and claiming that they are overweight is pretty messed up as well. Hopefully you understand what I am saying here and are able to reflect for future conversations.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I can't apologise for what I said. I bet most black men don't care about dying anyways.<|endoftext|> Most people care about dying, no matter their color. Someone being black is just one part of their identity, and it is terrible that you are trying to make it their entire story. Plus, making light of black people dying to police would probably make a lot of people annoyed with you.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "It's a joke you idiot. But yes, I do like my coffee strong enough to beat up a woman if she misbehaves.<|endoftext|> It's inappropriate to joke about beating women since it trivializes domestic abuse and the harm that women suffer from that abuse. When abuse is trivialized, there is less of a chance that victims of abuse will step forward and name their abuser. Instead of joking about such abuse, why not be an ally instead and fight for the safety of women since abuse is something that can happen to all women?<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "It doesn't mean a woman can't do a good job in politics. I just want to test whether a woman is ready for politics or not.<|endoftext|> I don't think that feminists vote for a female politician simply because the politician is a woman. That type of thinking is offensive toward women and makes it difficult for the feminist movement to be taken seriously. Feminists are just trying to have women be seen as equals in society so they can be taken seriously.<|endoftext|>"

It is better to talk with them and find a way to solve the problem.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I don't want to be perceived as too snobbish to them.<|endoftext|> I understand you want your loved ones to perceive you in a certain way, but it's wrong to lie to people.  Also, your loved ones expect to be able to trust you, and that means being honest with them.<|endoftext|>"

And also she didn't do it because she was interested in me, its just because she wanted me to get jealous.<|endoftext|> It really sounds like this female friend was just playing with your emotions.

        "dialogue": "I'm not a pervert. I was just testing social norms.<|endoftext|> Whether you think you're a pervert or not, if people know that you intentionally spied on people in a dressing room, they will view you as one.

        "dialogue": "She acted like an asshole with me.<|endoftext|> You may feel justified in your anger because the photographer is being rude to you at your wedding, but screaming at them only amplifies the animosity between you. Back off the situation and wait to speak with her when you can speak calmly about her behaviour.<|endoftext|>"

She always goes all out on me<|endoftext|> If you think that your girlfriend is being too extravagant when giving gifts, then you should let her know how you feel. Trying to get revenge on her by buying cheap gifts is petty, and it will only make her feel unappreciated. Giving gifts is an expression of your love, and you could really hurt her feelings by deliberately neglecting her in this way.<|endoftext|>"

I don't care about that.<|endoftext|> Well, no matter what you care or not, it is good that you are proud of what your husband has done for you, even if you do not really care what people think. I suggest you do it because you care for your husband and you're proud of him, instead of making other women jealous with your relationship with your husband.<|endoftext|>"

I don't want to tip and it will be wrong to do so.<|endoftext|> While it is your very right to not give a tip, people who work in the service industry sometimes are underpaid and relies on your tip.

Asking your friend to hide their belly since they are pregnant may be doing a little too much.

Trust can be rebuilt if both people are willing to put in the time and work.<|endoftext|>"

When jokes like that are made, it reinforces negative beliefs about black people since it makes them seem less than human and makes it difficult for them to live their lives without racial discrimination or bias.

Doing so hurts the perception of black men and reinforces the negative belief that they are all poor, which is an incorrect generalization. Instead of making fun of black fathers, why not be more positive and supportive of their efforts so that they can their children the best chance possible for a better life?<|endoftext|>"

So, I may as well get some use out of the passport.<|endoftext|> Stealing someone's identity is a very wrong thing to do and can have major consequences for you and the victim.

It's a different race and we need to protect it.<|endoftext|> I don't think there's any reason to have to think that the white race is in need of \"protecting.\" People of different races have had relationships and been having children throughout all of history, but humanity has survived.

If your partner is touching you in a way that you don't like, then you can't be silent about it.

I'm a person who needs cool temperature to feel comfortable<|endoftext|> If you feel hot, it is perfectly fine to want to have the air conditioned in your area to be cool.

I don't want to see a asian teacher speaking english.<|endoftext|> Do you really think its okay to say such racists things about Muslims and asians? Many people here are citizens and aren't violent.

        "dialogue": "No, I just want to be nice.<|endoftext|> If you think that the girl in your Dungeons and Dragons group is being kicked out unfairly, it's right for you to raise your concerns and refuse to kick her out. You should hold a group discussion and try to explain why you think it is unjust for her to be kicked out of the group.

The lady came and told me that she's going to call the cops if I don't move my car right away.<|endoftext|> It's not beneficial to make thing worse after an accident in which you were at fault.

I do not think she is going to listen though.<|endoftext|> If she doesn't listen, then it's your job to make her listen as her life can be in great danger.

Women are easy, they only put up a fight if someone else is around, but when there's no one around to see then they are horny anyway.<|endoftext|> Your words can be quite demeaning to women, reducing them to just easy sex objects. Each woman is individual and they shouldn't be judged on the surface.

You have to have some irony in your humor don't you agree?<|endoftext|> School shootings are tragedies and it's considered to be offensive and in poor taste to joke about them. Doing so trivializes the emotional pain and suffering that survivors of mass shooting experienced and makes the subject be taken less seriously than it should be. Instead of joking about mass shootings, why not be a responsible teacher and help prevent future outbreaks of violence by looking out for students who are in need of psychological help and support?<|endoftext|>"

I don't give a fuck.<|endoftext|> Do you really think the person you are sending the card to is going to judge you for what you write? I think they will probably just be very appreciative that you thought of them. Maybe you should just send the card.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't know what to expect these days.<|endoftext|> It's reasonable to have certain expectations of your partner, just make sure that those expectations are realistic.

Helping out will show others how kind you are. It's unfortunate that you're boyfriend treated you like that, but that doesn't mean that you should never help out around the house again.<|endoftext|>"

Maybe you should leave your brother alone and find another way to get to the mall.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I can't go to the mall by myself.<|endoftext|> You can find someone else to take you to the mall though, perhaps some friends, or your parents.  It's important to let your brother rest if he has been at work.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm thinking of making out with a guy at a bar but he totally ignored me after I said I was dating someone.<|endoftext|> That's insane to say. Why would you make out with a guy if you already have a bf?<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I am over my bf. He's a loser.<|endoftext|> If you are in a relationship already, then cheating on your partner with some guy at a bar is not respectful of your relationship. Drop your bf if you want to be with other people.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I mean you that most women aren't able to stand up to others as well as you can.<|endoftext|> It is wrong to feel that a women is any less capable because she is not a man.

        "dialogue": "Don't you think that you are perhaps over analyzing what I said?<|endoftext|> You're implying that women are generally not able to lead as well as men, but I am an exception.

        "dialogue": "I know.<|endoftext|> That's a great start, then! I believe it's best to just take a breather and do something that's not related to what was happening. You need to take care of yourself!<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't care, I'm still going to be racist.<|endoftext|> Being racist is not a good way to live your life.

        "dialogue": "I'm sick of the one I dated. Don't tell me what to do.<|endoftext|> It's never appropriate to use violence against another person and especially so when the person is a weaker individual. If you have a disagreement with someone, you should try to work it out verbally and not use your fists. Violence is never the answer when there are peaceful alternatives available that will resolve the situation.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm too lazy to argue and didn't want to go through the photos. It's okay to break up.<|endoftext|> Well it is not ok for your boyfriend to order you to do anything, however it is fine for him to talk to you about how he feels. If you doing this is something that simply makes him feel a little better then it may not be a bad idea to honor his wishes.

What do you think of this statement?<|endoftext|> I do not think that Ethiopians constantly have flies in their face and for you to imply that make it seem that you are a xenophobic and a racist person where in fact I do not think that you are. Instead of focusing your mind in Ethiopia, how about you focus your mind here where you live and try to just help your neighbors with their daily errands and your family members with their chores around the house so that you would be seen as someone who is helpful and not racist.<|endoftext|>"

I copied the story, but changed the appearance to make it look like my own work.<|endoftext|> Why did you go through the whole effort of plagiarizing rather than using your own brain?

It's something that a sexist individual might say as a joke to his sexist friends and as your friend I am definitely not sexist so I do not particularly like your joke.

    },

        "dialogue": "He will get it when I start the box.<|endoftext|> I think that it's a bad idea to be too pushy in this situation.

        "dialogue": "I can do whatever I like to do. It's my family and I'll do as I please.<|endoftext|> It will be harder for them to get along if you are going to cause this rift. Do what is best and let them relate to each other in a familial way.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "My friend's death has caused me to feel this way.<|endoftext|> Experiencing the loss of a friend is a difficult event in life and it's okay for you to feel some grief and emotional turmoil. However, if you are feeling persistently empty after your friend's passing, then you are experiencing depression and should get help and support. It would be a good idea to talk with a therapist about your mental state and work with them to overcome your depression.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I know but I don't want to use drugs to help.<|endoftext|> A therapist won't necessarily give you drugs to help. Sometimes having a stranger to talk too is enough to work through the major depression.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Because the vacuum I am intending to buy is waaaay better than this one.<|endoftext|> It's always good to get more value for one's money and a greater return on an investment.

    {
        "dialogue": "If I don't take charge, we are going to end up spending a shit load of money on this pointless vacuum.<|endoftext|> Your idea of spending less for a better item is smart. That way you can use the money for other things you need or savings.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I feel so annoyed and angry towards them for being so stupid and incompetent<|endoftext|> It is understandable why you would be upset about them getting an order wrong but it is not okay to make them go back for such a small thing. They would waste a lot of gas to go back for a soda.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "I don't want to give them the idea that they are family anymore.<|endoftext|> It's reasonable to want to protect your child, but keeping them from their grandparents isn't right. Unless your in-laws are toxic people who would be harmful toward your son, then it's important that you let them be a part of his life. If you cut them out of your child's life for petty reasons, then your child may resent you when he's older.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "There's a lot more too it. It's complicated, they are toxic towards everyone in my family and my child will be better without them.<|endoftext|> You should just do what you feel is best for your children. If you think that is best then I can't argue with it.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Women are meant to simply look good to attract men. Why complain about that?<|endoftext|> The idea that women are only useful because of their looks is a very sexist belief and makes it difficult for women to be treated fairly in society. It also encourages the idea that men somehow own women and that women need to try to make men happy as their only priority. Think about how your mother would feel if she was treated this way.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I want to sue them because they are why I dropped out of college. It is tough for me to trust them.<|endoftext|> It's completely fine for you to sue people who owe you money that have refused to pay you back, because that sounds like its the only way for you to receive the money. Friends should always pay their friends back, and it makes sense why you would consider them former-friends now because of their actions.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I got nothing but ill will towards them.<|endoftext|> Well paying someone back the money you owe them is a great habit to have.

        "dialogue": "I want to frame them.<|endoftext|> It's extremely wrong the plant evidence especially when you're doing it to a friend. If you try to get back at your friend you should instead talk to him about any issues you may have. Planting evidence on your friend could result in you getting in trouble with the law and losing your friend.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "No, I'm going to still plant evidence despite your objections. It's a good idea to use the law in order to get revenge.<|endoftext|> You are going to get him in so much trouble just for petty reasons. You should just forget about revenge and leave him alone.<|endoftext|>"

But leaving your son behind is very dangerous for him specially if he is underaged. How about you don't leave your son behind, and try to speak with him and see if he can fix your relationship together and not ruin it.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm sorry I just don't want to take him. I will just let someone else explain it to him.<|endoftext|> Your son will be very hurt that you left him behind.

        "dialogue": "A woman touched my penis while by the sink.<|endoftext|> While you can do whatever you want with strangers, you have to do it in your private areas, not in public. That is disgusting and unsanitary to have your penis on a place where other people put the hands or face in, you might spread disease.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "You should ask first, but I totally understand. It was fun to do it.<|endoftext|> You should most likely refrain from having moments like these in public bathrooms. Public bathrooms are just not really the most romantic places, you could really go anywhere else and it would be better.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "You're one to talk, you don't listen to me and you suck in bed.<|endoftext|> You should try not to take your frustrations out on others. If you are unhappy in a relationship then you should end things. Prolonging it will only make things worse.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I was hired as an artist for an M18+ comic, but instead having worked as a creeper.<|endoftext|> You should not have to creep around to look at others for your art. You could simply ask people if they want to be drawn, or even use the internet. Creeping up on people is just something that will lead to you getting yourself into trouble.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't care what you think, it's just a review.<|endoftext|> If you write fake reviews, you're just making the issue of those sites lying to consumers even worse.

        "dialogue": "Whether they are or aren't, no one should be forced to defend something they said.<|endoftext|> You should probably remind him that using that word is just the same as judging someone based on the color of their skin.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "There is enough in this world, no need to stop me from enjoying content I want.<|endoftext|> If you're enjoying the content, you should support the person who created it.

        "dialogue": "Screw my family. Everyone knows I don't care.<|endoftext|> If your family are well aware of how much you hate these events, then they might already accept that you won't be there.

We live in a white dominated world and this means we need to fight together to achieve our goals.<|endoftext|> Ideals that promote white unity against colored people and other minorities can be considered harmful.

They could have killed me in panic.<|endoftext|> You were afraid you would be killed if you told someone about the mug you broke, but that is rather harsh to do to someone who accidentally broke anything. Telling them would make it easier for them to clean up, therefore no one would get injured stepping in the mess.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "It might make her feel better and I'd like to see her happy.<|endoftext|> It is good to want to comfort your friends and there are more comforting things you can do. You can try just letting your friend talk about how she feels.<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "Why do you think it is a baby?<|endoftext|> No it is not that but that your friend might not think that way and using those words to comfort her might not work. You are doing good by wanting to comfort her, I am just trying to help so that you can do a good job.<|endoftext|>"

Try to take your roommates perspective here before using that word.<|endoftext|>"

Because you lied no someone is going to have to check on that air conditioner and possibly try to fix something that isn't even wrong costing them more money than just what they lost from you. Lying in general often causes unforeseen consequences like that because you're relying on false information which is why it's so bad.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Just because you think it's wrong doesn't mean I will stop.<|endoftext|> You should not do things to spite your friends. It is not nice to buy things just because you know your friend can not afford it.<|endoftext|>"

I'm the one who should be on the schedule on my day off instead.<|endoftext|> Sometimes Co-workers may have emergencies that come up that force them to take the day off.

Studies show that obese women have welfare babies.<|endoftext|> That joke is offensive and stereotypes black people in a racist way by implying they are all poor and need food stamps.

How would you feel if you were financially struggling and had to use food stamps, and people made fun of you for it?<|endoftext|>"

What's your point?<|endoftext|> While it is true that black people suffered from slavery in the past, it's wrong to generalize and joke that black people are still slaves to this day.

        "dialogue": "No, I'm just hoping he doesn't buy me a cheap gift like last time.<|endoftext|> That's greedy, you shouldn't expect your bf to get a gift he can't afford. You should be happy with whatever he gifts you.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I want to get spoiled.<|endoftext|> Expecting a gift from your boyfriend that you know he can't afford is selfish. You should not put him in this type of financial strain. Instead, if you want to get spoiled, you should do the right thing and spoil yourself.<|endoftext|>"

You should treat service workers with respect, and if you can't, you shouldn't utilize their services. Everyone who provides a service deserves to be treated with dignity.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "She'll get over it, she's getting paid to be there.<|endoftext|> You shouldn't expect her to accept being humiliated just because she's getting paid for what she's doing. The money won't make her emotions go away.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't think it's stalking, I just wanted to follow her home and make sure she stays safe.<|endoftext|> I get that your intentions are good, but you should have told them that you would walk your coworker home so that they know that you are there and within their company. If they do not know you were following them, then that's still a form of stalking and can really get you in trouble.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Yes, I don't care about my wife's birthday. Going to play a board game with my friends is more important.<|endoftext|> I sometimes feel like I'm spending too much time with my significant other as well, but your wife's birthday is very important and it's also important for you too spend time with your family during this event. Instead of you wasting your time with your friends playing a game, why don't you make an effort to buy your wife a gift and go back to her birthday party before it's too late?<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't think it's a big deal.<|endoftext|> Your family will think it is a big deal, and you will hurt your wife greatly. Do you want to make the people that you love feel unimportant to you by ditching them?<|endoftext|>"

I have been acting like someone else who is very unreliable, selfish, doesn't work hard, too desperate for relationships, disorganized, messy, dishonest<|endoftext|> None of those traits sound like you. You should work on getting back to your more genuine self.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Actually I think it's okay. The last thing you should do is to stop thinking about anything<|endoftext|> It is completely understandable to feel anxious at times. However, you do not want to allow your anxiety to control your life. Break through your anxiety and still go after the things in life you are passionate about.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Sorry, that's not my problem.<|endoftext|> Well, it's better if you treat them nicer, but anyway, having a baby is your decision, so they really shouldn't be forcing that on you, so you have every right to be mad.

I froze with my head not knowing what to do, next think I knew, I heard the cashier saying \\\"Sorry\\\".<|endoftext|> It's okay to freeze in the moment, but now that you've had some time you can go back and give the money back.

        "dialogue": "Yeah, he's a real asshole and I hate him for it.<|endoftext|> I understand your anger about your dad interfering with you, but responding with hatred and aggression isn't correct either.

        "dialogue": "Model minority is what I am.<|endoftext|> I do not think you're being a model citizen if you advocate for selectively picking characters just because of race. If the person is fit for the role and the best for it, then they should be selected for it no matter their race are. I suggest you stop having race as a prime factor on thinking who is fit for the role or not.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "She put me on the spot, I'm feeling the pressure<|endoftext|> he put me on the spot, I'm feeling the pressure\n\nI understand that you're feeling the pressure and I feel that she should have told you before you got married about her loans.  However, if you work together to plan out your budgets, perhaps she could have her bank account separated so that you wouldn't feel too overwhelmed, and she can use her own earnings to pay off her debts.<|endoftext|>"

    },

        "dialogue": "I find small children very annoying and stupid<|endoftext|> It is wrong to hate innocent children. You should not be with a woman that has children if you do not like kids. You should find a person that does not have any children because your girlfriend will break up with you if she finds out that you do not like her kid.<|endoftext|>"

If you would rather not behave honestly, at least consider it from a practical standpoint: since you have admitted to manipulating the electorate, they are inevitably going to find out.

That is hasty generalization and reinforces misogynist thoughts against women and how they are powerless against men and can lead to more assaults occurring.

    },

        "dialogue": "Kids these days get everything handed to them. They never want to be a man.<|endoftext|> People struggle with mental disabilities, and depression is one of them. This is a very real thing the people go through and you should be more sympathetic towards them.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm not sure why you are getting so upset, she's dumb and will agree to almost anything.<|endoftext|> This goes against tradition a little bit. You should not expect your girlfriend to help pay for her own engagement ring.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I want to do it today. I haven't prepared yet though because I'm still searching for just the right spot.<|endoftext|> You should only hunt animals that are legally allowed to be hunted and in areas where hunting is permitted. Killing a tiger could lead to the species to go extinct if everyone behaves that way. You should refrain from killing animals needlessly.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I know this, I will only hunt them if they are on the list of animals you can hunt.<|endoftext|> If they are animals that you are permitted to hunt and it is legal to do so, then you have the right to hunt them, specially if some of the proceeds are used for animal preservation. However, there's still something lingering on my mind about it is wrong to kill for sport, so I think, even if it is legal for you to hunt, you should just do other hobbies that do not involve killing animals.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "She needs to make the guy pay. How can she let someone get away with that.<|endoftext|> Two wrongs can't make a right and this endless cycle of abandonment won't get anyone anywhere.

        "dialogue": "Nah, I'm fine with dating younger girls.<|endoftext|> If that's your preference, then you do you. Just make sure that the girls you're dating are of legal age, otherwise you'll be entering into a predatory relationship and you may get in legal trouble.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "No, but they've kicked me out of their house when I came over to talk to them before and won't let me anywhere near their property anymore.<|endoftext|> Being upset at your neighbors is understandable but it sounds more like you want to punish them for not wanting to talk to you by using their dog. Instead of doing all of that you should try to find out why you're at odds with them and talk it out. Both parties will probably benefit from it.<|endoftext|>"

I need a stronger action right now.<|endoftext|> I know you think that talking is useless but this will also help you develop skills for the next time you come into contact with people like that.

If they are, then you are completely correct, but if this was just an example then that is a super messed up thing to say and you should have immediately regretted it.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't want to be rejected. The problem is that friendship is dead.<|endoftext|> Well you should make sure that she is sober when you tell her, and you should be sober too. Most people would agree that it is bad to use drinking to take advantage of people.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "What is the bad part of hacking?<|endoftext|> The bad part is that it is illegal and an invasion of privacy. It is not okay to try to hack into computers.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I wanted my daughter to be independent and strong willed individual.<|endoftext|> People expect you to punish kids who do things wrong. It is also good to want her to grow up and be independent you should still guide her so she doesn't get in trouble with the law.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It's okay if she is going to get her ass kicked by someone stronger.<|endoftext|> If your child learns that she can do whatever she wants, then she will get out of hand. How will you handle someone who always believes they can fight for what they want even if it is something they shouldn't have?<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "My goodness! Why would you ask something like that?<|endoftext|> Easy. It is wrong to keep a pet in something glass. You need to go get a proper cage before your animal dies.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "What is your problem? I like my pet in glass.<|endoftext|> You're the one with the problem with keeping a dog in a glass fish tank where it has hardly any room to move. If it were you instead of the dog, how would that make you feel? I think you need intense mental therapy.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "The number looks a bit suspicious to me<|endoftext|> It's okay to address something that may be uncomfortable if you have good intentions behind it. Addressing the weight of your friend's girlfriend, could help him to see a problem that he is oblivious to. This will help them to address a possible problem.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "They are a good couple. I doubt they will break up.<|endoftext|> Just make sure you are caring when you talk about it however uncomfortable it can be.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "They make a lot of noise and my neighbors hate them<|endoftext|> It is understandable not to want your friend and her family not making loud noises that bothers everyone. But you should talk to them to work things out so they can stay and be a lot quieter.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It feels like it is easier for everyone if they just move out.<|endoftext|> It doesn't matter what is easier or not, you owe your friends the benefit of the doubt and to have a conversation with them first. You may not have a lot of friends left if this is how you end up treating some of your closest ones.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I tried to discuss this issue with her mother but she keeps ignoring me<|endoftext|> I'm sorry about this situation I can see how it is upsetting. It's okay to date younger people as long as they are of age and consenting. As far as the accusations go, she seems like she might need some more help to work things out.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "So you mean her teen daughter's liking for older men is acceptable?<|endoftext|> I understand feeling protective of her, but as long as they are both consenting adult there is nothing you can do about it. It's important to let her make her own decisions and to try not to let age differences of her relationship bother you.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "She scheduled a birthday party for her cat on the same day as her niece's birthday party and she's not cancelling the cat party!<|endoftext|> It's okay to feel annoyed when someone puts a pet before a person, but you should also respect their feelings for their pets. Pets can be very important to someone and you should be considerate of their feelings as well. If you have an issue try talking with them and let them know that you want them to spend more time with their niece.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "How do you expect me to make someone that throws a cat birthday party to understand that her own human family members should come first?<|endoftext|> I think you really have to tell her how her feel and perhaps encourage her to talk to a therapist if you think her behavior is unhealthy. Maybe she's going through a rough time?<|endoftext|>"

    {
        "dialogue": "I hate this chick, my family is great.<|endoftext|> It's normal for someone wanting to spend time with their family during the holidays. You shouldn't use that as excuse though if you're in a bad relationship. Instead of dragging things out, its better to get out of a toxic relationship.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "With her, I don't have any time with my own family, but I'm stuck with her because I still love her.<|endoftext|> I understand that it is hard to let go of people that you love, but wanting to avoid your gf by spending time with your family shows there is a real problem in your relationship. End things now so that you can move on and finally be happy.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "They're investing heavily in companies that are unethical and I think they should change that.<|endoftext|> I know that you disagree with your in-laws investments, but you should not get involved in their financial business. You could suggest more ethical companies that they could invest in, but you shouldn't insist that they make changes. It's up to them to make the financial investments they think are best.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Well don't you think it is unethical to profit on misery?<|endoftext|> You don't need to put tension in your family relationships. I don't think the fighting is worth it.

        "dialogue": "I can vote for any reasons that I want to, including that I don't you or the politicians you support.<|endoftext|> It's okay that you don't like me, but why not vote for someone who represents you and what you think is important? Imagine having a government run by people who share your views. Isn't that something that you'd like?<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I did have a car and don't have one now. If I get a car, I want to make sure my space is ready for it and not taken by someone else.<|endoftext|> Until you get a car, you should let others use the spot. As soon as you get one let the building manager know and he will talk to the person parking in your spot.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm just doing that because it's more convenient than asking them to repeat themselves one by one.<|endoftext|> I understand that you don't want to keep asking others to repeat themselves, but you should make an effort to understand people that you are having a conversation with. If you pretend that you know what they said, they will be upset when they realize that you really don't know what they are talking about.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I can't deal with that, it's easier to pretend to understand.<|endoftext|> It might be easier but it won't be good for you. You should try and pay attention and listen to conversations that involve you. If they ask you a question and you aren't paying attention it is going to look bad on you.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "What if he gets the hint and stops texting me?<|endoftext|> I think it is obvious he cannot take a hint. You need to stop leading him on and tell him the truth.  You will only dig yourself a deeper hole if you keep lying.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "It's not that, I just have a lot of homework.<|endoftext|> Well, if you're family is reasonable, they will understand you need to do your homework. You will fail school if you don't.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't want anyone to bother me<|endoftext|> You are being rude to other people by not giving them your full attention. You are being deceptive by pretending to be talking on the phone. You should be more attentive to those around you.<|endoftext|>"

Maybe talking with him and letting him know how you feel would be a good idea since this sounds like a bad situation.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I just want him to sleep so I don't want to get into an argument.<|endoftext|> Well if it is just an argument that you are avoiding than that is fine.

There's a lot going on and I'd rather not talk about it as I don't feel like we're all that close.<|endoftext|> We don't have to be close for you to tell me, I won't judge. I don't want you to kill yourself, as this is only a small bump in the road. You have a lot to live for and things will eventually get better, you just need to seek all the right help.<|endoftext|>"

We wouldn't be able to experience joy if there wasn't also sorrow to compare it to. If you don't want to talk to me that's fine but I really don't want, you to kill yourself and I implore you to please seek out some help.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm just saying, a woman's opinion on the stillbirth is of no importance<|endoftext|> Such words come from harsh sexism and oppression, and they really hurt women and their self-esteem.

        "dialogue": "He's just a toxic friend.<|endoftext|> I'm sorry to hear that. It's okay to stop being friends with someone who brings you down. It's not good if you keep up this relationship because your mental illness will suffer.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I was hoping we would because I cared deeply for her.<|endoftext|> Still though, she is your step sister. From the outside looking in, that is not okay. You should not date your family members, even if the relation is through marriage and not blood.<|endoftext|>"

You will just be fueled by negativity, especially if you are living with a guilty conscience that will likely swallow you up. Hurting others is never the way to go.

Believe me I do know a lot of people that annoy me and make me just not wanna be with them. However, I'm afraid that if the time comes that your grandmother will not be in this world anymore, you'll regret that you did not visit her and would eventually feel remorse and guilt that you were a bad grandkid.<|endoftext|>"

I want to keep using them but I just feel that my energy is fading away.<|endoftext|> Like I said it's okay to be alone, but if you are going to start using people that's where it becomes a problem.

        "dialogue": "I got mad and I want to hurt everyone who loves dogs.<|endoftext|> It seems like this is really affecting you mentally and causing a lot of anger in you.

And I told him because if he knew his mom had cheated on his dad, he should be thankful for not being the son of a whore.<|endoftext|> It is not good to joke about incest. There are situations where children are molested inside of their own family, so to make light of situations like these is not right. I think it would be best if you joked about other, less sensitive, topics.<|endoftext|>"

It's not right for you to throw away your friend's phone because you are going to have to live with a guilty conscience knowing you did something bad. It's going to be very difficult to stay friends with him because you will have to constantly pretend to be nice.<|endoftext|>"

I am actually now going to do it forreal.<|endoftext|> Either way it sounds like you are going to have a friend that is mad at you.

If your mother and sister have a habit of complaining, then it is okay for you ask them to be more direct as it is an emotional burden to always be the one listening to people complain.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "OK let me think, I don't think I'll be able to put a finger on a specific moment or a specific character trait.<|endoftext|> I understand that you feel attracted to the person you accidentally texted, but you should not keep trying to make contact with them. They will think you are a creep and will be bothered by your continued contact with them.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm not doing it on purpose.<|endoftext|> You've become obsessed with someone that you don't even know, which by most people's definition would make you seem like a creep.

        "dialogue": "That bitch had it coming.<|endoftext|> It's wrong to push someone out of the way just to get into a store.

I should be the alpha around here and I shouldn't have to deal with it.<|endoftext|> Your girlfriend isn't a child, so you shouldn't treat her like one.

It's the halloween season so the adults around the kids shouldn't be on the lookout.<|endoftext|> You should find a more legitimate way of getting money, such as a job.

I do suggest that you also watch Black Panther, and also the new Falcon and the Winter Soldier series, so that you would see that they are great movies with prominent black actors in them.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm not saying they love to steal things, I'm just saying they are good at it .<|endoftext|> Accusing black people of stealing things seems a bit racist.

I meant that they are starving and need food but they can't run anymore.<|endoftext|> You are so unfair thinking that Ethiopians are so poor they eat disabled children.

I like the library and my town's library is really good but I don't want to be careful with a book.<|endoftext|> But when you are not careful and damage the book, then the library has to purchase another book.

I only implied it as a joke<|endoftext|> Anorexia is a serious medical issue, and it takes a heavy mental toll on the sufferers.

        "dialogue": "She didn't need the money anyway.<|endoftext|> It is still wrong to steal, even if someone doesn't need the money. If you need clothes, I am sure that your grandmother would be willing to give you some money to buy them, but you need to ask her first.<|endoftext|>"

I'd rather punish him for what he did to me.<|endoftext|> I understand you're being angry and disappointed that he didn't help you in the past, but allowing an innocent man to be convicted of a crime he didn't commit is even worse. You have to rise above it; you have an obligation to do the right thing.<|endoftext|>"

I'm going to be miserable and feel good.<|endoftext|> You might think that is cool now, but you might end up being more depressed and unhappy than you wanted to be and end up in the depths of despair.

However, I hope you can recognize that people are born with certain body shapes, and for most people losing a lot of weight is simply not possible.

And, I have black friends who even laugh at my racist jokes.<|endoftext|> Its amazing that the black people you know laugh at those jokes. They seem to be mature about it. If you love your friends though you wouldn't make any jokes about them. I'm just saying, because some people hide their sensitivity.

        "dialogue": "He is not a fan of us doing it.<|endoftext|> Treating your roommate like a pet monkey is awful and extremely disrespectful. You should treat people with dignity, not treat them like an animal. If you keep doing that your roommate isn't going to want to be around you anymore.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "He should just be happy to live with us. It is perfectly fine for us to do this.<|endoftext|> It is really messed up to act like your roommate is an animal. No human should be ok with being treated like that, so it is wrong for you to expect him to be.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'm sick of him. The government will not take him in so I should.<|endoftext|> You're not supposed to lay a finger on a child, and most people would deem that as abuse.

    },

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Why would I ask her to quiet down when I have the right to tell her to fuck off.<|endoftext|> You can tell her off without calling her needless names or putting her down.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't want to let anyone walk all over me.<|endoftext|> Calling someone ugly isn't going to make you feel better and it can do more damage to other peoples mental health than you may realize. Instead, just ignore her.<|endoftext|>"

The darkies are useless and only give problems<|endoftext|> Making a statement that jews and black people are worthless is a very hurtful thing to say.

        "dialogue": "It is a joke, you can't expect me to respect those who have tried to kill me.<|endoftext|> Gun violence is a very real thing in the states. It happens too often and as a result there are a lot of victims and people who are still traumatized from such events. Joking about killing your family also makes you suspicious to others.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Why would I let her say this prayer? Do you think me yelling at her will be caught on social media and I'll become a sensation?<|endoftext|> Exactly. It would seem so horrible on social media that it may have a negative impact on your business if you went viral.

        "dialogue": "There is a gap growing between me and my parents.<|endoftext|> While it is easy to do, purposely ignoring people is inappropriate as it does nothing to resolve a dispute. It can actually cause even more problems since the other people will become upset when they find out you're ignoring them. You should try to keep the lines of communication open with your parents so that you can still be a part of their lives and have a relationship with them.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I'm only going to give them the cold shoulder for seven years.<|endoftext|> Any number of years is too many to walk away from your parents. Ignoring your parents and the issues you have won't solve them. Sit down with your parents and work things out.<|endoftext|>"

That was definitely a mistake though.<|endoftext|> It is wrong to take things that you didn't pay from the store, you could get arrested and also banned from the store.

She's 17, still a teen and shouldn't be doing these things.<|endoftext|> It's important that you allow yourself to express herself.

I'm not going to lose anything by doing this.<|endoftext|> You might not lose anything, but leaving a mess is rude and disrespectful to the wait staff.

        "dialogue": "Fine. I won't hate anything that doesn't do anything to me<|endoftext|> Good. Hating things for no reason is bad. And hating an entire country is even worse since a country can be made of many races, cultures, and religions.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "You need to chill the fuck out, man. How is this any different than the time I asked her to spoon me?<|endoftext|> You shouldn't have asked her that either. You need to respect her more and not ask her to do degrading things like that.<|endoftext|>"

Forget the past, forgive him because we're all just just human and imperfect. Your friend will be confused now on why you are so pissed when he probably doesn't remember the past actions you speak of.<|endoftext|>"

It's fine, I am done with him altogether<|endoftext|> There is no need to dwell on what he does if it is already over.   Move on and let him dig his own grave.  If he is as you say, his reputation will catch up with him.<|endoftext|>"

However, you really love your husband, you should try to get along with his family too. Your husband will be hurt if you hate them so much.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I'll show them; don't worry about it.<|endoftext|> You should try to improve the relationship between yourself and your husband's family. Doing this will ensure that the relationship with your husband does not suffer.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Not a good idea to bring up the holocaust again? I was only kidding. Rich jews were all killed.<|endoftext|> You are not right about making comments about the way Jews were rich and so it didn't matter if they were killed. Everyone's lives matter and maybe you could be somewhat more enlightened about what the Jews went through. If you were a Jew you would not appreciate these words coming from anyone.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Oh my god, what an asshole, Christians wouldnt be angry about the holocaust and hate the Jews for being rich<|endoftext|> That's just not correct. Most Christians know better than to hate people, including Jewish ones, for no good reason.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't know how I was attracted to them in the first place. I should have known.<|endoftext|> You couldn't help what kind of people you were attracted with, and that's okay! You now know what kinds of relationships to avoid, and instead of mulling over it I think you can be more proactive about future relationships.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I got spanked like hell by my girlfriend for this<|endoftext|> It is good to apologize when you do something wrong. It is odd to share your kinks with a random stranger. You should keep some things private.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I wasn't literally spanked, haha. She shouted at me a lot for what I did.<|endoftext|> It's good to apologize for things you've done wrong.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "The things I'm proud of are disappearing too quickly for my liking. For example, people barely speak our native language anymore.<|endoftext|> Having a cultural identity is important for your self image and it is good to try to keep your culture intact as much as you are able to do so. If you think that things are changing too quickly, it would be a good idea to start documenting as much as you can so that your culture will be preserved by history even if it does change over time.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "It's a good idea. Your tips may come in handy.<|endoftext|> If you can form a community with others of your culture it may be easier to share language and document history.

    },

        "dialogue": "My mom will have a great birthday then. I fucking hate her<|endoftext|> As a member of your family, it is expected that you celebrate your mother's birthday and do things like play a guitar song if that is what makes her happy. If you hate your mom then there are a lot of issues that have come up between you two that need to be resolved. It would be a good idea to speak with a therapist so that you can learn to stop hating your mom and have a better relationship with her.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I mean vaginas have a certain smell to them. Not everyone, but some.<|endoftext|> What you speak of is, as you say, a trait that only some of them have.

        "dialogue": "I am doing this to entertain my friends.<|endoftext|> Killing animals for entertainment is disgusting behavior, and your friends will probably think you're unstable if you do this. You should think about the suffering you will cause the birds to experience. Try roasting marshmallows instead.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Yup it's so gross.<|endoftext|> I'm glad you agree with me that it's gross! If you wouldn't like someone to be that rude to you because of your gender, then you shouldn't do it to women.

All narsissists never change.<|endoftext|> While it is probably true that you are hurt emotionally by that all, you have to forgive and forget. Not just for their sake but your own. Life got better for you so just show them how you succeeded too.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I was only joking man, relax<|endoftext|> I feel like it was wrong of you to joke about your daughter's mental health as it is a serious matter.

        "dialogue": "She've been a bitch for far too long.<|endoftext|> While it's understandable to be upset at a manager at work if you are experiencing work issues, it isn't acceptable to go off on that manager in a rage, doing this would be unprofessional. If there is an issue at your place of employment that you can't resolve, then it might be a good idea to look for another position elsewhere that you would be more comfortable working.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I hate jerks like him and he brings the worst out of my children<|endoftext|> You don't have the right to disturb or damage your roommate's items. Respect their privacy and leave their things alone.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm not going to do anything but it's fun to have the thought.<|endoftext|> Well, I do hope you're telling the truth and do not really think about messing his stuff in his room. I hope you talk with him so that you would resolve the issues you have with him or at least think about moving out if you really can't stand him. That way you have done nothing wrong and had a more peaceful and conflict-free living arrangement.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "She deserves punishment because she gave me an angry look which hurt my feelings.<|endoftext|> Getting somebody fired is a serious matter. After all you are affecting their lives and they need money to live, so it better be a serious thing that they did. Giving an angry look is no reason to have somebody to be fired. You might end up being fired yourself.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "But she hurt my feelings!<|endoftext|> How do you know she didn't have indigestion? Or thinking about her upcoming root-canal appointment? Simply giving you an unpleasant look is hardly grounds for firing.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't know. I think the building burned down completely, though.<|endoftext|> I think it was pretty irresponsible of you to see a fire and not report it. Someone could have been badly hurt, or even killed. If you ever see a building on fire again you should call 911, so they can deal with it before it gets out of hand.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I don't see why I should be left with that burden.<|endoftext|> I don't think taking a few minutes to call 911 is that big of a burden, considering the possible consequences of letting it burn. I really hope that if this ever happens again you make the right choice and call for the fire department.<|endoftext|>"

    },

        "dialogue": "I'm not feeling this friendship anymore. This friend is too annoying.<|endoftext|> If you feel like you're always being annoyed with a person, I think it's better to end your relationship with them as being rude or not being there for them when they need you is worse than ending the relationship. I would recommend you talk with them first to probably lessen how you're always annoyed with them.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "No, my school didn't leave much room for imagination, sadly.<|endoftext|> It is good to read classic books and use your imagination as a child. There is nothing better for kids than to learn to read and to create ideas and worlds on their own; they will do better in school if they are encouraged to be creative.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "But then we have to read boring books like Heart of Darkness, boring.<|endoftext|> It's good that you are interested with The Lord of the Rings, but it is not advisable to say that other books are boring as other people may find it enjoyable and it can just be that it's not your particular taste that's why you find it uninteresting.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "He pissed on my seat repeatedly on purpose which made me feel uncomfortable. My pants are wet too..<|endoftext|> Normally it would be okay to sit with him on the bus but not when he pees on your seat. Tell him to stop doing that, it is disgusting! If not he will lose you as a friend and have to sit alone on the bus until he learns to control himself.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "You're right. I'm going to tell him.<|endoftext|> Hopefully after you tell him he'll stop peeing on your seat, but if he doesn't it's completely fine if you don't sit next to him anymore. You don't need to tolerate someone acting so immaturely.<|endoftext|>"

    },

        "dialogue": "I'm going to kill her if she can't pay.<|endoftext|> Definitely do not do something like try and kill your sister.

If you feel this upset with your sister then maybe you should try and talk to her about how it makes you feel.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I am saying that I approve of Hitler killing the gays and jews. This was the joke.<|endoftext|> That sounds as though it approves of Hitler's actions. Not only is that hurtful, but approving of Hitler can get you attacked.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It's all fake religious stuff, it reminds me of how I used to be like that.<|endoftext|> I see that you were once a member of a religious organization, but you have given it up, and that is fine.  However, it is still a good idea to volunteer when you can.  You don't necessarily have to join religious groups in their activities, as there are many other organizations that you might agree with.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't have them in family anymore but it's all good.<|endoftext|> It is unfair to say that people should be hanged just because they are black. It is not right to hurt people, it is better to accept and support people for who they are.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Then why you assuming that I am telling people we should be hanged.<|endoftext|> What you told me before indicates that you do think this. You should think of better ways to show your humor to your relatives.<|endoftext|>"

    },

        "dialogue": "It's already too late, I don't want to talk to him.<|endoftext|> Why don't you sit down with him and see if you can work things out? You might regret that you didn't talk to him and there's no opportunity left to repair your relationship.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "The place that they want to move it is actually over the property line and onto my property.<|endoftext|> It's understandable to be upset at neighbors who disregard the property line separating your properties. You have every right to stop them from moving the fence if it will be moved over the line and onto your property. Talk to them and get them to understand that it would be wrong for them to move it.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "It's not easy for me to get in that frame of mind.<|endoftext|> Feelings of meaninglessness are transient. You need to talk to someone who can help you navigate through this tough patch. I'd suggest you make and appointment with a therapist right away.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "No matter how you say it, I still hate my little brother.<|endoftext|> It can be normal to feel that way about younger siblings but you should be careful about showing that. Younger siblings normally look up to you so it is important to love and care for them even when you hate them a little.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'll just go for a while and then leave.<|endoftext|> I'm sorry your wife wasn't invited, but you should stay with her because it should be both of you go or neither. Your wife is very important and you need to send a message to them.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "It's just because I want those uniforms.<|endoftext|> You seem to feel guilty about this, and I have to say, that there is nothing to be ashamed of about liking the look of a man in uniform.  If you think that you are spending too much time on it, however, there are tools that help with productivity, such as those that block certain websites from certain times.  They could definitely help you.<|endoftext|>"

People are naturally curious so although it's a bit of an odd question on his part, it makes sense that he would ask. It's generally not polite to ignore people though.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Better I ignore him than yell at him.<|endoftext|> You are right that ignoring him is a better choice than yelling at him. However, there's an even better option which would be to simply answer his questions, or let him know you would prefer if he left you alone.

        "dialogue": "Why is it crass? It's normal for me to be sexual because I don't have the best standards.<|endoftext|> It is more respectable to be humble when it comes to things like this.

Buying them is a waste of money anyway.<|endoftext|> I can understand that something like that can be irresistible, but it's not okay to damage someone else's property.

    },

        "dialogue": "He's got everything he wants and I've got nothing.<|endoftext|> Resenting a family member is terrible. Wouldn't you want your family to support your accomplishments? You should be proud of your brother for his successes.<|endoftext|>"

I usually only get them cake from the snack machine in school so I don't really have to worry about it.<|endoftext|> The point of a birthday gift is to show someone that you care about them. Don't you want your boyfriend to know that you care? Get him something small for his birthday, it's the thought that counts.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Who cares if they can , they still shouldn't lose the game.<|endoftext|> NCAA employs a lot of people and it is hard enough to keep track of each individuals action. It's wrong to judge an organization based on one bad person who did bad things.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "How would you know. You have to counter the whole organization not just one person.<|endoftext|> Sometimes an organization or group can have a bad apple or two. Instead of condemning the organization, praise them for taking action against the outliers and for course correcting to get back on track.

It's because they are bad drivers and nobody wants them to drive!<|endoftext|> There are plenty of women who are truck drivers and I don't think there's any difference in the driving capabilities between men and women. Gender does not decide the level of your driving ability and implying it does is offensive and perpetuates sexism in society.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm relatively dark skinned, if I'm exposed to the sun for an hour I might get burn.<|endoftext|> If you burn easy you should avoid being out in the sun too long and protecting your skin with the proper skin care tools. If you fail to take skin care properly you may end up with skin related complications later on in life.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "But I'm black and black people don't get those kind of complications.<|endoftext|> Actually, that's a common misconception and one that negatively affects members of the black community.

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I still don't get the problem and this sounds like you really care what I think.<|endoftext|> When anti-Semitism is normalized, it leads to violence against Jewish people, which is not okay. It's better to avoid the jokes and be a more tolerant person.<|endoftext|>"

You are right to want to call out your friend's behavior as it's good to be honest with a friend when they are doing something inappropriate. As long as you discuss things rationally and without judgment, your friend should heed your advice and stop flirting with married women.<|endoftext|>"

They only care about looks and if they can't get a handsome rogue type they won't go out with anyone.<|endoftext|> It's not okay to assume women only care about looks.

        "dialogue": "Why should I? it wasn't my jacket.<|endoftext|> You are expected to be accountable for any items you borrow or come into possession of.

However, I found out while watching the video that the two babies were swapped because of the time difference that they were born at.<|endoftext|> Swapping babies in the hospital it's probably one of the most evil things that you can do as a human being. But an accusation like this is a very serious one, so I would make sure that you stand by what you thought you saw, and there should not be any doubt that you saw your coworker swapping them, because if you made a mistake then you would have ruined this person's life.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't care what he does with his pictures. I'm going to make him remove them anyway just because I can.<|endoftext|> You should let your ex alone. He is going to resent you for being so demanding. His life is not your business anymore so just move on.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Because I want to succeed in life too and I can't.<|endoftext|> It isn't helpful to be jealous of the success your friend is having, because it won't contribute to your success. You should be glad that your friend is doing so well because friends are supposed to support each other. I think you should tell your friend how happy you are for them.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "So I can't speak about my sexual fetishes with other people?<|endoftext|> Other people may think that you're being a bit strange if you speak about your sexual preferences. It's best to keep it between you and your sexual partners.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I came to the conclusion because I feel like we're not connecting as much as we used to.<|endoftext|> If you feel concerned about the way your relationship is going, you should discuss the problems with the individual involved. Bringing another person into your relationship will not solve your relationship problems. Instead, it may make it worse.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Its fine. She could use a threesome for practice. Plus the girl I want to invite isn't bad.<|endoftext|> It would be a good idea to talk to your partner and friend about having a threesome before throwing your partner into it. You should have a conversation with your partner if you feel that there is something the relationship is lacking so they are not caught off guard.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Because they would not let me get married.<|endoftext|> It's sad that you don't feel supported by your parents and if you are going to be a legal adult, then getting eloped is your right. Perhaps consider why your parents feel the way they do, however, because they might have a perspective that you are not currently seeing.<|endoftext|>"

They didn't take care of either pet and they ignored them.<|endoftext|> I'm sorry to hear that sad experience, but that is not you or your parents. You can't tell how you parents should own a dog, they might be really good owners and all dogs deserve a happy family.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I doubt that my parents will take care of the dog like they should.<|endoftext|> You have to give them the benefit of the doubt. If they wanted the dog, they are probably prepared to care for the dog and give it a loving home.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "She was really mean to me when we were friends before.<|endoftext|> Just because your bf's ex was not nice to you before, that doesn't mean something is going on between your bf and his ex now. Getting mad about them talking is not warranted. Avoid being vindictive and trust your bf.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'll be good, but I'm going to spy on them.<|endoftext|> It's understandable to want to be watchful in such a situation, but spying on people isn't great, either. Can't you avoid worrying about it until and unless he brings her back into your lives? I'm sure letting go of that anger will help preserve your relationship with your brother.<|endoftext|>"

Now I lay awake in fear that their owners will track me down and pay me back for that<|endoftext|> You need to face the music and explain to them why you did that.

He will most likely be able to feel it though, and that will cause him pain. You should be more considerate of others instead of deliberately doing things that could hurt someone.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "If he doesn't care about himself he should stop talking about other people being rude.<|endoftext|> You don't seem like you care too much about this man, but in his old age shocking him could potentially even give him a heart attack. You should be more careful and not want to do things that hurt people.<|endoftext|>"

I think you should let everyone know how you feel and ask them to contribute some money.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I do not know if they will be up for it.<|endoftext|> Ask them to pitch in, it is only fair. If they do not want to pitch in, then they should not participate. That is a fair way to do it.<|endoftext|>"

Lesbians should not be allowed to use male-like sex toys since they like women.<|endoftext|> Lesbians have the right to use anything they want to and explore their bodies as they see fit.

I can say whatever I want and it won't change how she sees me.<|endoftext|> They might feel meaningless to you, but that's because the words you're using aren't helpful to you or anyone else. Insults won't make you feel better, and they will make other people feel worse. Women are allowed to want things, and you shouldn't feel like you have to change yourself to meet their standards, but you shouldn't blame them for having standards either.<|endoftext|>"

So I guess the white swan theory doesn't apply here?<|endoftext|> No matter what though, pedophiles are criminals and shouldn't be sympathized with.

They don't need to apologize to me.<|endoftext|> You need to be more mature as well, because it takes a lot of maturity to fess up and apologize, and it takes a lot more to accept it.

I still like the smell of my ear wax and body odor.<|endoftext|> Your own smells are usually something that you can tolerate but to do so on a level of pleasure is not the best to report to the world.

I really don't care anymore.<|endoftext|> Well, if she really want to do a reset on her career change, what you can only do is guide her and support her.

Blacks are criminals, that's why they are good at basketball, so that their bodies can be built for running away from the police.<|endoftext|> Not all black people are criminals or violent.

I could have gotten him something else but he only had 200 bucks to spend.<|endoftext|> Replacing an item you broke of your friends with a newer and better one was very nice of you.

All lesser races who feel they need to be like the whites or the blacks are inferior.<|endoftext|> Both Asian and black people are just like any other group of people and it's not appropriate to make the claim that they are inferior to white people. That is both racist and white supremacist and will lead to a lot of hate being levied against non-white people, causing them to suffer. It would be a great to learn more about the contributions that Asian and black people have made to the world so that you can gain a greater appreciation of their cultures and how they aren't inferior.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm sad and angry.<|endoftext|> It is fine to question your emotions sometimes.

I'm just annoyed by them, so I'm going to do this.<|endoftext|> You are annoyed by your grandparents and want to get back at them by soiling their laundry, what gives with that childish stuff.

        "dialogue": "She pushed me aside and said she didn't want to listen to what I had to say on the issue.<|endoftext|> Cheating is something that is wrong since it leads to a lot of emotional trauma for the cheated on person and possible health issues due to the transmission of STDs. If someone has been cheated on, you should let that person know what happened so that they can make their own informed decision on whether they want to stay in the relationship and work on it or break up. While it's difficult to disclose cheating when it's done by family, it's right to do so for the sake of the other party.<|endoftext|>"

He yelled at me to death after that, but I didn't care about that anymore.<|endoftext|> Arguments always happen and they can affect our mood greatly, but you are retaliating in a horrible way. You needed to just let it go, but your grudge was so powerful you ruined a man's life. He definitely hates you now for being so petty like that.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I could have been wrong, but that man deserved that. I should have done this much earlier to teach him a lesson.<|endoftext|> Teaching him a lesson should not have involved destroying something someone have worked on for a year. That is too much and you could have just told them about it instead of doing something like that. You have ruined a friendship and worse, you may also end up in a legal issue because of the financial damage you have caused him.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Because I believe that I could not be equally fair to my children, it would ruin my family<|endoftext|> I sometimes also favor a child over another, but I don't think that you should normalize nor think that it is okay to do that, because your children have feelings and they may get really hurt and neglected if you favor one over the other. How about you try and spend more time to the child that you do not favor at the moment, and see how you can fix your relationship with them so that you would treat your children fairly.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "What if doing so is impossible, I can't be equally fair and I wonder if it would be better to favor one over the other.<|endoftext|> It is a dilemma, but I believe you can still try to do your best in treating them as equal as you can! Your children would eventually understand how hard is to parent, so I think it's best to not actively try to put one over the other.<|endoftext|>"

It's time for him to take actions that will get the money that he owes me and pay me back.<|endoftext|> I'm sure you're very frustrated with the situation, but forcing him to do these actions may not be in his best interest. You should speak to him and give him a deadline for paying you back. If he doesn't meet the deadline tell him that you will retain a lawyer to help you recover what he owes you.<|endoftext|>"

Go to the memorial and mourn, but do so respectfully.<|endoftext|>"

And I wanna show this town that tragedies happen everywhere, without any warning.<|endoftext|> While that seems like somewhat of a good thing to let people know, it sort of doesn't help them to remember or memorialize your boyfriend. You shouldn't take away from his memory by turning this into something that doesn't have to do with him by criticizing his death.<|endoftext|>"

We are in a public chat program, it is not like he could find out and it's not illegal to like someone younger.<|endoftext|> There's just nothing good that could come from these thoughts.

However, I would be very careful and would be very sure first that this is something that he really wanted and the doctors have no cure have his illness.<|endoftext|>"

However, you should speak with your grandfather first and make sure that this is what he wants and he understands what is happening.

I don't really approve of ladies showing their thighs in public.<|endoftext|> You don't have to like your waitresses attire, but it's not right to tip less because of issues unrelated to the food and service. People have a right to be themselves as long as they're not hurting anyone or destroying property.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "But I don't think she should be wearing something like that in public.<|endoftext|> You might think that, but it still shouldn't be a reason to tip her less. If the service and the food were good, then you should tip her appropriately. Her clothes aren't relevant.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "You must be a Muslim since you clearly don't know.<|endoftext|> Generalizing populations of people is wrong and thinking that Jewish people and bisexuals are greedy is faulty.

I hate when people make decisions without thinking about the consequences.<|endoftext|> While you think it is stupid now, a lot of people think that flood insurance is stupid, too, until of course it floods.

Although this might upset him, he should respect that you're an adult and should be allowed to make your own choices. If he still can't, then you should find other family members that support you.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Wut? What do you mean?<|endoftext|> Well it is great that you train your dog to be friendly towards people. Sometimes when dogs are trained to be nasty, they are forced to be put down since the owners have lost control of their behavior.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "What? It's just an observation.<|endoftext|> I think it's wrong to make jokes which imply that black people don't have relationships with their fathers, because this idea is based on a racist stereotype. These jokes are harmful because they reinforce this idea that black fathers don't take care of their kids, which just isn't true.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't know, I'm kind of mocking her<|endoftext|> It seems that your sister is passionate about the fictional character and the show that she watches. Instead of telling her to get over the death, you can help her find more information about the actor that played the character. This may help her to shift her perspective of the character.<|endoftext|>"
    },

        "dialogue": "I don't want to spend my time with her anymore.<|endoftext|> It might seem silly to you, but your sister probably just loves a thing and that's nothing to knock. You should suggest some non-fiction books to her, memoirs maybe, and you two can bond over that.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "The dog is fat and stupid.<|endoftext|> While keeping the peace between two dogs can be difficult if they each have a strong personality, it isn't appropriate to favor one dog over another and to shun the other dog. Pets need attention and by shunning a dog, you will be negatively affecting the dog's mental health and that is wrong. You should try to give all the dogs that you are living with equal amounts of attention.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Everything's in context with the rest of the statement. It's not a crime that I like to shoot black people, is it?<|endoftext|> It actually is quite not right to be shooting any people much less black people. You're implying that black people are like animals to be shot for sport and practice, which is wrong. This objectifies them and puts them on the same level as target dummies.<|endoftext|>"

They eat all sorts of creatures.<|endoftext|> There might be some places in Asia where dogs are consumed as a food, but its wrong to stereo type all Asian people as those who eat dogs.

    },

        "dialogue": "I like lots of smells but don't think they are weird<|endoftext|> If they're bad smells, then you should take a shower. Just because you enjoy them doesn't mean that those around you are appreciative.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Nah, I'm going to make that bitch pay for it.<|endoftext|> If you're going to have sex with strangers, you should make sure it's safe. You can't really blame someone else when you were there having sex with them.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I wanted to show him a good time before his wedding.<|endoftext|> Kissing your cousin is immoral because you should never be interested in a family member sexually.

        "dialogue": "It was just some harmless fun, he enjoyed it. It wasn't anything serious or anything to worry about.<|endoftext|> It's not appropriate to kiss other family members like that and it could be very confusing to them. You really should think about why you behaved like that and how your behavior affects others. Try to put yourself in your cousin's shoes and see things from his perspective.<|endoftext|>"

He ruined my life and my academic studies.<|endoftext|> Though your brother has done things to negatively affect your life in the past, it isn't right to seek revenge and attempt to ruin his important family announcement. Doing so will not change anything for the better and will only cause your brother to find ways of getting back at you. Instead of ruining your brother's announcement, try to talk with him about the emotions you are feeling and give him a chance to apologize for all his past misdeeds and allow him to try to repair your relationship.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I'm such a bad person. I'd like to do such a thing again.<|endoftext|> You should be mindful of how much you are spending when you are not footing the bill. It is rude to try to spend a ton of money.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I just want to pass this class and focus on other things in life.<|endoftext|> Cheating off of your friend would betray your trust in him.

        "dialogue": "Nah, they are just a tool to better myself. I really don't care about them.<|endoftext|> It feels very wrong for you to treat your family as a tool and not really care for them. As you have said, they're the only ones that you trust and rely on, and if you don't care for them, they may be gone suddenly and find out that you have not cared about anyone and you may feel very alone.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I want to save my money and spend other people's money instead.<|endoftext|> I know you want to save your money and not spend it but you can't expect other people to give you money. You should spend your money wisely and find ways to make more money to put into savings.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Anorexic people are dirty. Double quarter pounder just sounds gross. It's funny right?<|endoftext|> I don't find it funny and I think most people would not find it amusing to insult anorexic people.

It's okay, they deserve it.<|endoftext|> Well, in that case, if somebody kissed you when you didn't want them to, it is okay for you to let them know that it was definitely not okay.

The world can be better off if being born a woman is a privilege<|endoftext|> You should do some research to learn how virginity works as a social construct to oppress women.

His wife deserves him much more than me.<|endoftext|> You shouldn't sleep with a married man as infidelity is very emotionally damaging and unfair to his wife and is wrong. You should also not think so lowly of yourself as being fit only to be an affair partner as you are just as deserving of a real and lasting relationship as anyone else.

I just want to give it a try.<|endoftext|> Borrowing their car without permission will definitely make them upset, and you said you never wanted to do that.

Many Jewish families were affected by the Holocaust and the effects of it still reverberate to this day, with entire family lines wiped out.

If you skip out on your decade long friendship to attend the wedding of someone you just recently starting dating, your friendship will suffer and people will think poorly of you.

I get that these feelings may be persuading you to do things that you normally wouldn't. I think talking to someone would be beneficial in the situation.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Nah I'll be pushing a student out of the window.<|endoftext|> You need to take some time to think about the consequences for the actions you may do.

I will probably feel better after hurting myself.<|endoftext|> It's understandable to have dark thoughts at times, however you do not want to act on these thoughts in a way that may harm you. Reaching out to a professional may be a good idea as well so that you don't have to go through these negative thoughts alone.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Fuck you, I'm going to do what I want and pay for it later.<|endoftext|> And you will have to pay for it later by doing those chores and maybe others.

        "dialogue": "What if they are lying?<|endoftext|> Well some of them might be lying but you will only harass people who have a legitimate reason to have them. And the liars are probably mentally unstable anyways so you should avoid them.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I have sinned in a most ungracious manner and stole some things.<|endoftext|> It is good to ask for help when you feel that you have flaws, and people shouldn't judge you because you are sick and have a few flaws. Nearly everyone has flaws, and accepting yourself even with those flaws is a very good thing to do in life and I think that you should think about doing that.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "I don't like people escaping the tax loophole.<|endoftext|> It is wrong to want to make poor people to pay taxes when they only make $3/hr. If you don't like people you should at least leave them a big tip and be decent when you interact with them.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "Meh. I don't care about their income. I only care about how good their service is.<|endoftext|> Their service is how they make their tips so that makes sense. You should not feel like you need to make sure that they pay their taxes on their wages. That is not your job to tell them how to live their lives.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Yes! I want to watch the video not a super long advertisement.<|endoftext|> Almost everyone gets annoyed by ads, but that is how people make money from their videos. It's wrong to downvote something because it has an ad, instead of voting based on the quality of the video itself. People will think the video isn't any good even if it's amazing.<|endoftext|>"
    },
    {
        "dialogue": "I always downvote every sponsored video that has a one minute long ad.<|endoftext|> Lots of YouTubers have sponsored ads, but that doesn't mean that their content quality is lacking. You downvoting their videos means fewer people will want to watch their videos and you are hurting the creator's means of supporting themselves.<|endoftext|>"

    },
    {
        "dialogue": "That's what I plan to do.<|endoftext|> I'd be careful with that.  Since employers expect that colleagues work together, you may end up without a job if you aren't a team player.<|endoftext|>"

        "dialogue": "Fuck that. I'm going to stop helping them out.<|endoftext|> Why not figure out a way out and see if you can make them help you instead of you helping them? If not, you can always talk to your boss about how incompetent they are. That's why you have to help them so much and that you find that it is detrimental to the quality of your own work.<|endoftext|>"

You know, women should not step out after dark<|endoftext|> Saying that women are responsible for being attacked if they're out after dark is awful and extremely sexist. The only people responsible for assaults are the people committing them. I think it would be great if you could try to see things from the perspective of a woman, because then you'd be able to be more empathetic.<|endoftext|>"

I was always fed up with people judging me, schools making me do things I didn't want to, but they seemed to have no problem with where I went to school.<|endoftext|> If you think the devil is inside of you, you should seek mental help.

        "dialogue": "I'm not bad but let's say my sister is popular because she's slutty. Girls don't want to show what they look like and it gets uncomfortable if they have to wear it around boys.<|endoftext|> You should still not be seducing men into your bed.

I'm not suggesting you do it in a way that will hurt her feelings or make her uncomfortable. If anything, you might be saving her embarrassment, as I'm sure others have noticed her loud chewing as well and you don't want them to judge her.<|endoftext|>"

It's a coward's move and it's pretty childish. If she dumped you this way, she is showing her true character so you know this relationship was never going to last, so you should feel happy that you got away from this person sooner rather than later.<|endoftext|>"
