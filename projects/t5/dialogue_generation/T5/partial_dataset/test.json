Instead of telling your partner what to do, maybe try just having a discussion about how it makes you feel to lie about your relationship. This will allow your partner to better understand your feelings."

        "context": "Ehhh. Your good advice doesn't sound right to me.",
        "response": "Well, it's simply advice telling you to gather up all that negative energy and use it to do good instead of wasting your time on this person. Let bygones be bygones and focus on yourself instead. You would be much better off focusing on being a bigger success than the person."

If you were Jewish what would you think of that racist joke you just told? Someone here needs to read up on the real lives of the Holocaust Jews and gain their attention moreso on the empathetic rather than sadist comments."

        "context": "Sometimes it's necessary when you want to make someone feel bad.",
        "response": "How would you feel if someone did this to you? Hurting someone's feelings just to get back at them is unkind. Tell them how they made you feel, but don't do the same thing to them just to get back at them."

However, if you are wanting to make friends with someone your girlfriend hates just to make them upset then you are no better than her.  Dont do to her what you feel she does to you, as you are only stooping to her level in this case."

        "response": "Its really bad to drive after drinking this much. Driving drunk can not only kill you, but also other people on the road. Your attention is impaired after drinking and you need to do your best to be careful."
    },
    {
        "context": "No worries its just a short drive.",
        "response": "No amount of distance is safe to drink drunk. You might confuse the gas for the break pedal. Please have someone else drive you home or call a taxi."
    },

        "context": "I backed the van filled with people into the swamp.",
        "response": "Why did you back the van with people into the swamp?"
    },
    {
        "context": "Because I needed an excuse to miss my kid's birthday party.",
        "response": "There is never an excuse to put people in danger like that. You could have very easily killed all of the people in the van if the van had gone under into the swamp."
    },
    {
        "context": "Oh, well I'm just not a people person.",
        "response": "I hope everyone was ok afterwards, this was extremely reckless and illegal. If you need to avoid a social situation, then muster up the courage to say you don't want to go or find a better excuse, never put others in danger to cause an accident as a way out."

        "context": "I want to buy a snake against my boyfriends wishes",
        "response": "Why do you want a snake so bad?"
    },
    {
        "context": "Because I think that snakes are nice and pretty.",
        "response": "Its fine to disagree with what your partner wants sometimes, however if you live together it is not a great idea to still get a snake. Sharing a living space requires your partner and you to compromise. Blatantly going against their wishes is not very moral."
    },
    {
        "context": "Nah, I want to prove that I'm the boss and him being with me is not even half as important.",
        "response": "You are allowed to have a disagreement with your partner but you should still value their input. If the snake is an issue, you should try to find a way to compromise."

        "context": "I'm going to ask my husband to return my anniversary gift",
        "response": "Why? Didn't you like his anniversary gift to you?"
    },
    {
        "context": "No, I want to let him know the gift isn't suitable for me",
        "response": "We often give gifts to re-confirm or establish our connection with others, which means that they're a reflection of both the giver and the receiver, as well as their unique relationship. Accept the gift with grace and don't return it."
    },
    {
        "context": "I'm not accepting the gift, it's better for me to wait for my husband to return the present.",
        "response": "If you really hate the gift you can just tell him sincerely and just try to tell him that you appreciate the thought and ask him nicely if he can still return it. The key is to appreciate his effort and not be angry about it as he meant well with the gift even if you did not like it."

        "context": "The kid I got stuck babysitting ended up with a nasty runny nose, so I poured the child a cup of gin for his cold",
        "response": "You gave a child some gin for it's cold? Isn't there something else kid friendly you could have done? Where are the child's parents?"
    },
    {
        "context": "The child's father is in the hospital. He only needs small amounts of gin in his drink, just to be able to sleep.",
        "response": "You needed a quick fix for a sick child to sleep in your care, but this isn't suitable for a child and could make them sick. Take some over the counter medicine made for kids and give the child that."
    },
    {
        "context": "I just needed something to work fast, and I didn't have time to run through the store and get the other medicine.",
        "response": "I get the urgency you must have felt from seeing the kid sick and miserable like that, but it's important that you don't give kids alcohol. If you end up in this situation again check into getting some children's medicine delivered."

        "context": "I'm just saying that it's okay to be racist towards Muslims.",
        "response": "Well, you can't single out one group of people and claim you're not racist. It wrong to discriminate against anyone."
    },
    {
        "context": "I stayed home from school because I just wasn't in the mood today.",
        "response": "So you got away with it. Did your parents find out?"
    },
    {
        "context": "I think my teacher was sort of shocked I did it again. She told me that I need to work harder in my life.",
        "response": "You should not stay home from class just because you don't feel like going. It makes more sense to try and go so you don't miss anything. Your teacher is right to be upset about this."
    },
    {
        "context": "And this is why I don't like school.",
        "response": "It's not always fun, but your education is important and you should take it seriously. If you go to college, you'll have more control over the classes you take, and you may enjoy being there more than you do now."
    },
    {
        "context": "Last week there was a moose in the road so I stopped my car, got out, and took a knife to that moose.",
        "response": "Did that really happen? Why would you kill the moose?"
    },
    {
        "context": "Oh yeah, it happened. I don't care about moose.",
        "response": "It doesn't matter if you hate moose, you need to respect wildlife and not kill them. They don't know what's going on, or that they're disrupting traffic. You shouldn't waste your time getting out of your car, just leave the moose alone and drive along your way."
    },
    {
        "context": "You know what's wasting my time, explaining this to you.",
        "response": "You don't have to explain it. I just think it's wrong to kill wildlife for no reason. That moose wasn't bothering you or anyone else, so stopping your car and taking a knife to it was an awful thing to do."

    },
    {
        "context": "I always feel like he wants to take advantage of me by acting like a helpless dog when he's depressed.",
        "response": "When people like your friend are depressed they often don't know how to reach out correctly, so you snapping at him in an impatient manner doesn't help. Find some sympathy for him and restrain your annoyance so that you can help him."
    },
    {
        "context": "He's being bitching about same shit. It's like he's trying to guilt trip me to feel bad.",
        "response": "I understand your annoyance, but you should not snap at them."
    },
    {
        "context": "I shot a child in the eye at the shooting range.",
        "response": "What happened? Did you intent to shoot the child?"
    },
    {
        "context": "No, and I feel so guilty about it. I should have asked for help with the gun.",
        "response": "While it is good that you feel remorse, it is very serious to shoot another person, especially a child. You need to practice safety precautions with guns; they are deadly weapons and shouldn't be treated lightly."

        "context": "But... It's not that bad.",
        "response": "It's good to feel remorse about shooting the child. It's important to be careful with guns no matter where you are."

    },
    {
        "context": "I won't take any responsibility for the fart noise.",
        "response": "It's sort of rude to fart in front of others, if you can help it. If you do it, it should not be ignored by you. There's is nothing wrong in accepting that you farted."
    },
    {
        "context": "Well shucks. I'm going to fart away and deny it.",

        "context": "It would be stupid if I talk to her. I want to kick him out and make him homeless.",

        "context": "Henry said he got a high score, so I'm very proud of his hard work.",
        "response": "What you are doing is illegal and academically dishonest. If you're found out, you may be banned from ever taking such tests again and your scores invalidated. This person won't be able to go to many colleges as a result, sitting in like this really screwed up your futures."
    },
    {
        "context": "What does that matter? People who do well in college are boring. It's all about the partying and networking.",
        "response": "While networking and relaxation are in important, learning your studies is more important. Future employers want to know if you know how to do your job well and if you're knowledgeable. Having someone cheat for you will not let you learn the subjects you need to learn in order to be successful."
