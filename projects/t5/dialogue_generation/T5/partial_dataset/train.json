She will think you are a fake and then dump you, and you will deserve it because you are so mean spirited."

I'm sure I never heard of that before but it's still valid. Look at it as a way to say thanks for defending your country, it means you saved more lives more than killed lives."

        "response": "You can ask for what you want for Christmas, but expecting it to happen is kind of rude. What you're asking for may be hard to get, or too expensive. You should buy something yourself if you desperately want it, instead of relying on the good will of others."

There is a great book called the diary of Anne Frank and I think you would get a lot out of that book. It's simply wrong to joke that Jewish people deserved the holocaust."
